also known as u . s .  arsenal building ,  is a building located in macarthur park in downtown little rock ,  arkansas .  built in ,  it was part of little rock s first military installation .  since its decommissioning ,  the tower building has housed two museums .  it was home to the arkansas museum of natural history and antiquities from to and the macarthur museum of arkansas military history since .  it has also been the headquarters of the little rock sthetic club since .  perhaps because abraham lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as president ,  captain totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops .  he agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions the governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the united states .  the soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war .  the soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders ,  not as conquered and surrendering soldiers .  on the morning of february ,  rector and totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials .  that afternoon ,  the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with governor rector at its head .  all of the federal troops had left at this point ,  except totten who had stayed behind to listen to the governor s speech and to hand the arsenal over in person .  the little rock arsenal was classified in as an arsenal of deposit ,  meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis .  thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs ,  nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the arsenal fell into state hands .  most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the arkansas military board .  m .  cal flintlock ,  m .  cal percussion converted

unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration .  the sthetic club provided much needed financial support during the period and even paid the electric bill during the great depression .  the sthetic club is still headquartered in the tower building .  the arsenal was listed in the national register of historic places in .  due to its association with the camden

league nhl for the pittsburgh penguins ,  hartford whalers ,  toronto maple leafs and tampa bay lightning .  he was a standout player for boston university and is the school s all time leading scorer .  after the buffalo sabres selected him in the nhl supplemental draft but chose not to offer him a contract ,  cullen signed with the flint spirits of the international hockey league ihl for the season where he was named the ihl s co rookie of the year and most valuable player after leading the league in scoring .  his career was halted in when he was diagnosed with non hodgkin lymphoma .  he

natures more profoundly than others .  to know the true name of a deity was to have power over it .  the importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which isis poisons the superior god ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her .  upon learning the name ,  she tells it to her son ,  horus ,  and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power .  although the egyptians believed their gods to be present in the world around them ,  contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances .  in literature ,  gods may appear to humans in a physical form ,  but in real life the egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication .  temples ,  where the state rituals were carried out ,  were filled with images of the gods .  the most important temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary .  these statues were usually less than life size ,  and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods bodies .  many temples had several sanctuaries ,  each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad .  the city s primary god was envisioned as its lord ,  employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented .  the gods residing in the temples of egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon .  but many deities including some important gods as well as those that were minor or hostile were never given temples of their own ,  although some were represented in the temples of other gods .  egyptian gods were involved in human lives as well as in the overarching order of nature .  this divine influence applied mainly to egypt ,  as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order .  but in the new kingdom ,  when other nations were under egyptian control ,  foreigners were said to be under the sun god s benign rule in the same way that egyptians were .  official religious practices ,  which maintained maat for the benefit of all egypt ,  were related to ,  but distinct from ,  the religious practices of ordinary people ,  who sought the gods help for their personal problems .  south of heaven is the fourth studio album by american thrash metal band slayer .  released on july ,  the album was the band s second collaboration with record producer rick

released by def jam recordings ,  although the album became an american recordings album after rick rubin ended his partnership with russell simmons .  it was one of only two def jam titles to be distributed by geffen records through warner bros .  records because of original distributor columbia records refusal to release work by the band .  the release peaked at number and in was awarded a gold certification by the recording industry association of america .  king has since been critical of his performance ,  which he describes as his most lackluster .  king attributes this to the fact he had recently married ,  and moved to phoenix ,  arizona .  describing himself as probably the odd man out at that point ,  he admitted he didn t participate as much because of that .  hanneman said we go through dry spells sometimes ,  but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without .  i guess at that time ,  kerry was hitting a dry spell .  king has also been critical of the album in general ,  describing it as one of his least favorite slayer albums .  he feels vocalist tom araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style ,  and added too much singing .  drummer dave lombardo has since observed there was fire on all the records ,  but it started dimming when south of heaven came into the picture .  and that s me personally .  again ,  i was probably wanting something else .  tom araya bass ,  lead vocals jeff hanneman lead and rhythm guitar kerry king lead and rhythm guitar ,  backing vocals dave lombardo drums of the ,  civil aircraft registered in the uk ,  per cent are engaged in ga operations ,  and annually the ga fleet accounts for between .  and .  million hours flown .  the single most common class of aircraft is the fixed wing light aircraft associated with traditional ga ,  but the main area of growth over the last years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft ,  such as microlights ,  amateur built aeroplanes ,  and smaller helicopters .  there are ,  private pilot licence holders ,  and ,  certified glider pilots .  some of the ,  pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in ga activities .  although ga operates from more than ,  aerodromes and landing sites ,  ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips ,  over per cent of ga activity is conducted at of the larger aerodromes .  the ga industry ,  which is around per cent the size of its cat cousin ,  employs ,  people ,  and contributes .  billion to the uk economy .  ga is regulated by the civil aviation authority caa ,  although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the european aviation safety agency easa .  the main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing ,  and the objective is to promote high standards of safety .  at the lighter end of the ga spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies ,  and gliding is in transition from a self regulatory model to more formal governance by easa .  airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of cat operations has reduced the area in which ga flights can be freely conducted .  the growth in cat is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the ga sector ,  and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re development for more profitable uses .  the uk planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of ga public transport operations ,  and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the ga market .  the planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome related environmental issues which ,  particularly regarding noise ,  are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at ga .  the international civil aviation organization icao defines general aviation ga as an aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation .  it defines commercial air transport cat as an aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers ,  cargo or mail for remuneration or hire ,  and aerial work as an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture ,  construction ,  photography ,  surveying ,  observation and patrol ,  search and rescue ,  aerial advertisement ,  etc .  private flying can be for both recreational purposes and personal transport ,  using aircraft that are owned individually ,  collectively as part of a syndicate ,  or rented from a flying club .  a survey of pilots conducted between and indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome ,  visits to other aerodromes ,  and day trips away .  half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from ,  and only per cent involved an overnight stay away from home .  there are an estimated ,  civil aircraft registered in the uk ,  per cent of which are engaged in ga activities .  in the ga fleet comprised ,  fixed wing aircraft ,  microlights ,  helicopters ,  airships balloons ,  gliders and some ,  hang gliders .  estimates put the number of foreign registered ga aircraft based in the uk at .  the sector was estimated to employ nearly ,  people and directly contribute .  billion to the uk economy in ,  making it roughly seven per cent of the size of the cat industry .  nearly half of the economic contribution was generated by business aviation .  business aviation has shown strong growth ,  although the numbers of aircraft on the uk register have declined .  this reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign registered business jets based in the uk ,  which are estimated to be growing in numbers .  however ,  twin piston engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly ,  reflecting pressures on the light air taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services ,  and a more sophisticated corporate charter business .  the amount of flight training conducted by uk schools has declined ,  largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools ,  which benefit from lower costs and better weather .  there were fatal accidents involving ga aircraft in ,  resulting in the loss of lives .  these compare with accidents claiming a total of lives the previous year ,  and although the statistics are higher than average ,  they are not exceptional .  airspace is shared by cat ,  military and ga users .  it is divided into controlled airspace ,  in which aircraft must always be under the control of an air traffic controller ,  and uncontrolled airspace ,  in which aircraft can operate autonomously .  although ga flights can under certain conditions enter controlled airspace ,  they operate mainly outside of it .  the ship s primary armament consisted of four .  cm in caliber guns in two twin gun turrets .  this was augmented by a heavy secondary battery of eight cm .  in guns in four wing turrets .  the tertiary battery consisted of twenty cm l guns in casemated single mounts ,  four mm .  in l and one mm l quick firing guns .  furthermore ,  the ship s boats were equipped with two mm .  in landing guns for operations shore .  three cm .  in torpedo tubes were also carried ,  one on each broadside and one in the stern .  the fungus is found in europe from where it was originally described ,  and is widespread throughout north america .  the north american distribution extends north to alaska .  in ,  it was reported for the first time from turkey .  the gold dollar or gold one dollar piece was a coin struck as a regular issue by the united states bureau of the mint from to .  the coin had three types over its lifetime ,  all designed by mint chief engraver james b .  longacre .  the type issue had the smallest diameter of any united states coin ever minted .  in proposing his plan for a mint and a coinage system ,  secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton in proposed that the one dollar denomination be struck both as a gold coin ,  and as one of silver ,  representative of the two metals which he proposed be made legal tender .  congress followed hamilton s recommendation only in part ,  authorizing a silver dollar ,  but no coin of that denomination in gold .  in ,  the first gold dollar was minted ,  at the private mint of christopher bechtler in north carolina .  much of the gold then being produced in the united states came from the mountains of north carolina and georgia ,  and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by bechtler circulated through that region ,  and were now and then seen further away .  additional one dollar pieces were struck by august bechtler ,  christopher s son .  the gold dollar had a brief resurrection during the period of early united states commemorative coins .  between and nine different issues were produced ,  with a total mintage of ,  .  these were minted for various public events ,  did not circulate ,  and none used longacre s design .  the degree of reversibility in the initial step and therefore the diastereoselectivity depends on four factors ,  with greater reversibility corresponding to higher selectivity the treaty of ciudad jurez was a peace treaty signed between the then president of mexico ,  porfirio daz ,  and the revolutionary francisco madero on may ,  .  the treaty put an end to the fighting between forces supporting madero and those of daz and thus concluded the initial phase of the mexican revolution .  as early as march ,  madero s representatives met in new york with daz s finance minister ,  jos yves limantour ,  and the mexican ambassador to the us in order to discuss the possibility of peace between the two sides .  limantour proposed an end to the hostilities and offered an amnesty for all revolutionaries ,  the resignation of the then vice president ramn corral ,  the replacement of four daz cabinet ministers and ten state governors by ones chosen by madero ,  and the establishment of the principle of no reelection which would prevent daz from seeking yet another term as president which would have been his ninth .  madero responded positively although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an immediate resignation by daz .  at the same time there was also disagreement among the rebels .  the left wing of the revolutionary movement ,  represented by zapata and orozco villa for the time being tended to support madero ,  warned against any possible compromises with daz .  in the end their suspicions proved correct as the treaty that was eventually signed neglected issues of social and agrarian land reform that were central to their struggle .  the most significant point of the treaty was that porfirio daz ,  and his vice president ,  ramn corral ,  resign and that de la barra ,  acting as interim president organize free elections as soon as possible .  additionally ,  the treaty stipulated that madero and his supporters had the right to name fourteen provisional state governors ,  and to approve la barra s cabinet .  the treaty was signed on may .  daz resigned accordingly on may .  francisco de la barra became the interim president .  madero entered mexico city on june .  the feast of the goat received largely positive reviews ,  with several reviewers commenting on the book s depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power ,  and on the graphic descriptions of violent events .  the novel s narrative is divided into three distinct strands .  one is centred on urania cabral ,  a fictional dominican character another deals with the conspirators involved in trujillo s assassination and the third focuses on trujillo himself .  the novel alternates between these storylines ,  and also jumps back and forth from to ,  with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in trujillo s regime .  in the novel s final chapters ,  the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency .  the tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of the sim ,  the failure of the coup ,  the rape of urania ,  and the concessions made to trujillo s most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country .  the book ends as urania prepares to return home ,  determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island .  many of the assassins had belonged to the trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters ,  only to find their support for him eroded by the state s crimes against its people .  imbert ,  one of the assassins ,  sums up this realization in a comment prompted by the murder of the mirabal sisters they kill our fathers ,  our brothers ,  our friends .  and now they re killing our women .  and here we sit ,  resigned ,  waiting our turn .  in an interview ,  vargas llosa describes the corruption and brutality of trujillo s regime he had more or less all the common traits of a latin american dictator ,  but pushed to the extreme .  in cruelty ,  i think he went far far away from the rest and in corruption ,  too .  trujillo s attempted sexual conquest of urania is an example of both political manipulation of agustn cabral and sexual power over young women .  however ,  as trujillo s penis remains flaccid throughout the encounter and he is humiliated in front of the young girl ,  the encounter fails to satisfy his requirements for machismo .  the realist style of the feast of the goat is recognized by some reviewers as being a break from a more allegorical approach to the dictator novel .  the novel received largely positive reviews ,  most of which were willing to accept sacrifices of historical accuracy in favour of good storytelling .  fey was

lord shiva .  the rock cut architecture of the caves has been dated to between the th and th centuries ,  although the identity of the original builders is still a subject of debate .  the caves are hewn from solid basalt rock .  all the caves were also originally painted in the past ,  but now only traces remain .  the main cave cave ,  or the great cave was a hindu place of worship until portuguese rule began in ,  after which the caves suffered severe damage .  this cave was renovated in the s after years of neglect ,  and was designated a unesco world heritage site in to preserve the artwork .  it is currently maintained by the archaeological survey of india asi .  the island has two groups of caves in the rock cut architectural style .  the caves are hewn from solid basalt rock .  all caves were painted in the past ,  but only traces remain .  the larger group of caves ,  which consists of five caves on the western hill of the island ,  is well known for its hindu sculptures .  the primary cave ,  numbered as cave ,  is about .  km .  mi up a hillside ,  facing the ocean .  it is a rock cut temple complex that covers an area of ,  m ,  sq ft ,  and consists of a main chamber ,  two lateral chambers ,  courtyards ,  and subsidiary shrines .  it is metres ft deep from the front entrance to the back .  the temple complex is the abode of shiva ,  depicted in widely celebrated carvings which reveal his several forms and acts .  on the eastern part of the island ,  on the stupa hill ,  there is a small group of caves that house buddhist monuments .  this hill is named after the religious stupa monument that they display .  one of the two caves is incomplete ,  while the other contains a stupa made in brick .  the main cave blends chalukyan architectural features such as massive figures of the divinities ,  guardians ,  and square pillars with custom capitals with gupta artistic characteristics ,  like the depiction of mountains and clouds and female hairstyles .  the carving on the south wall to the east of the portico depicts shiva and parvati seated on their abode mount kailash .  the four armed shiva is seen with a crown and a disc behind it all damaged ,  the sacred thread across his chest ,  and a dressing gown covering up to the knee .  parvati ,  dressed in her finery with her hair falling to the front ,  looks away .  behind her at the right is a woman attendant holding the child ,  identified with her son kartikeya ,  the war god .  many male and female attendants are seen behind the main figures .  shiva s attendant ,  the skeleton like bhringi ,  is seated at his feet .  other figures ,  not distinct ,  depict ,  among others ,  a royal looking tall person ,  ascetics ,  a fat figure ,  a dwarf ,  a bull the mount of shiva ,  features of a garuda ,  and two monkeys .  the scenic beauty of the mountain is sculpted with the sky background amidst heavenly beings showering flowers on shiva parvati .  this scene is interpreted as a gambling scene ,  where parvati is angry as shiva cheats in a game of dice .  townsend s solo albums ,  a diverse mix of hard rock ,  progressive metal ,  ambient ,  and new age ,  have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians .  in he formed the devin townsend band ,  a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases .  in ,  he disbanded both strapping young lad and the devin townsend band ,  taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family .  after a two year hiatus ,  he began recording again ,  and soon announced the formation of the devin townsend project .  the project began with a series of four albums ,  released from to ,  each written in a different style ,  and townsend continues to record and tour under the new moniker .  in ,  century media records offered townsend a contract to make some extreme albums .  he agreed to a five album deal with the record label ,  and also provided much of the guitar work on the album millennium and the album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly .  townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad .  he avoided using his real name at this point in career ,  looking for a fresh start after his high profile vai gig .  at the beginning ,  i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasn t the best publicity to have ,  he later explained .  i was playing somebody else s music and i was judged in respect to that music .  townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album ,  heavy as a really heavy thing ,  which was released in april .  shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record ,  with the working title human .  townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to alien .  it s basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while .  the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january .  townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in synchestra ,  blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk ,  polka ,  and middle eastern music .  the final strapping young lad album ,  the new black ,  was released later in .  the second entry ,  a commercial ,  yet heavy album called addicted ,  was released in november and features lead vocals from townsend and dutch singer anneke van giersbergen .  brian beav waddell was recruited from the devin townsend band to play bass .  after writing ideas for over songs ,  townsend stated he is finally going to finish the whole project ,  followed by the announcement the album will be released on october ,  .  the recording process started in may ,  and the final project includes the album ,  a ziltoid tv program and a live show ,  with a big graphic novel comic and a documentary .  the album itself is a double album ,  with disc one being the main album and disc two featuring devin townsend project material according to townsend ,  the album s theme is ziltoid against the world .  the devin townsend project disc is called sky blue and the ziltoid disc is called dark matters .  townsend recently discussed at least a year long hiatus ,  beginning after the z show taking place at the royal albert hall on april ,  .  during the indefinitely long break townsend intends to recharge his batteries ,  get some inspiration and experiences and to see what the next chapter holds for him .  since the s ,  plans have been made to rebuild the synagogue in its original location .  due to various political circumstances ,  very limited progress has been made .  major disagreements exist between the government and jewish organizations as to how much the latter should be involved in decisions about the reconstruction project ,  including proposed design and character of the new building .  construction began in and was completed the following year .  the synagogue was officially consecrated on september ,  a ceremony attended by representatives of city and regional authorities ,  zagreb public figures ,  and many citizens .  it was the first prominent public building in zagreb s lower town ,  and its architecture and scale aroused general admiration and praise .  with the new synagogue ,  an organ was introduced into religious service .  the small minority of orthodox jews found this change to be intolerable ,  and they began to hold their services separately ,  in rented rooms .  in the earthquake ,  the synagogue suffered minor damage and was repaired the following year .  after world war ii ,  the vacant site of the former synagogue was used as a makeshift volleyball court .  the volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building ,  constructed in .  the department store was completely destroyed in a fire on december ,  and was subsequently dismantled .  despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot ,  and a architecture competition for its design ,  no construction took place .  instead ,  the parcel was turned into a parking lot ,  which it remains to this day .  in and ,  the jewish community of zagreb presented new plans for a ,  m ,  sq ft multi purpose jewish center and synagogue in praka street .  in june ,  the home office announced it would review the use of fits during public order policing .  the move was influenced by the discovery that information collected by fits ,  included that which was unrelated to suspected crimes ,  for example recording who made speeches at demonstrations .  liberty brought a judicial review of the overt surveillance practices in may ,  which was decided in favour of the police ,  however the police were asked to clarify their evidence to the court of appeal ,  following an investigation by the guardian newspaper .  after deciding that the statute s subject matter necessitated the strict scrutiny approach ,  the district court decided on june ,  that it was an unconstitutional violation of the right to vote for and select senate candidates .  this decision was appealed to the court of appeals for the third circuit ,  who decided against the use of the strict scrutiny approach and ,  in its absence ,  ruled that the statute was not a violation of the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments .  academics have been critical of both the decision reached and the approach used ,  with one suggesting that the substantial state interests test used in valenti v .  rockefeller would be more appropriate .  michael jeffrey jordan born february ,  also known by his initials ,  mj ,  is an american retired professional basketball player .  he is also a businessman ,  and principal owner and chairman of the charlotte hornets .  jordan played seasons in the national basketball association nba for the chicago bulls and washington wizards .  his biography on the nba website states by acclamation ,  michael jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time .  jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the nba around the world in the s and s .  jordan s second season was cut short by a broken foot in the third game of the season ,  which caused him to miss games .  despite jordan s injury and a record at the time it was fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in nba history ,  the bulls made the playoffs .  jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return .  against a boston celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in nba history ,  jordan set the still unbroken record for points in a playoff game with in game .  the celtics ,  however ,  managed to sweep the series .  jordan had recovered completely by the season ,  and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in nba history .  he became the only player other than wilt chamberlain to score ,  points in a season ,  averaging a league high .  points on .  shooting .  in addition ,  jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess ,  as he became the first player in nba history to record steals and blocks in a season .  despite jordan s success ,  magic johnson won the league s most valuable player award .  the bulls reached wins ,  and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year .  however ,  they were again swept by the celtics .  jordan led the league in scoring again in the season ,  averaging .  ppg on .  shooting and won his first league mvp award .  he was also named the defensive player of the year ,  as he had averaged .  blocks and a league high .  steals per game .  the bulls finished ,  and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in jordan s career ,  as they defeated the cleveland cavaliers in five games .  however ,  the bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced detroit pistons ,  who were led by isiah thomas and a group of physical players known as the bad boys .  in the season ,  jordan won his second mvp award after averaging .  ppg on .  shooting ,  .  rpg ,  and .  apg for the regular season .  the bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in years and set a franchise record with wins in the regular season .  with scottie pippen developing into an all star ,  the bulls had elevated their play .  the bulls defeated the new york knicks and the philadelphia ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs .  they advanced to the eastern conference finals where their rival ,  the detroit pistons ,  awaited them .  however ,  this time the bulls beat the pistons in a four game sweep .  in an unusual ending to the fourth and final game ,  isiah thomas led his team off the court before the final seconds had concluded .  most of the pistons went directly to their locker room instead of shaking hands with the bulls .  in his autobiography for the love of the game ,  jordan wrote that he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of .  the added exhaustion due to the dream team run in the olympics solidified jordan s feelings about the game and his ever growing celebrity status .  jordan s announcement sent shock waves throughout the nba and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world .  despite his january claim that he was .  certain that he would never play another nba game ,  in the summer of jordan expressed interest in making another comeback ,  this time with his new team .  inspired by the nhl comeback of his friend mario lemieux the previous winter ,  jordan spent much of the spring and summer of in training ,  holding several invitation only camps for nba players in chicago .  in addition ,  jordan hired his old chicago bulls head coach ,  doug collins ,  as washington s coach for the upcoming season ,  a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another jordan return .  playing in his th and final nba all star game in ,  jordan passed kareem abdul jabbar as the all time leading scorer in all star game history a record since broken by kobe bryant .  that year ,  jordan was the only washington player to play in all games ,  starting in of them .  he averaged .  points ,  .  rebounds ,  .  assists ,  and .  steals per game .  he also shot from the field ,  and from the free throw line .  even though he turned during the season ,  he scored or more points times ,  or more points nine times ,  and or more points three times .  on february ,  jordan became the first year old to tally points in an nba game .  during his stint with the wizards ,  all of jordan s home games at the mci center were sold out ,  and the wizards were the second most watched team in the nba ,  averaging ,  fans a game at home and ,  on the road .  however ,  neither of jordan s final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the wizards ,  and jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him .  at several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media ,  citing their lack of focus and intensity ,  notably that of the number one draft pick in the nba draft ,  kwame brown .  jordan s marked talent was clear from his rookie season .  in his first game in madison square garden against the new york knicks ,  jordan received a prolonged standing ovation ,  a rarity for an opposing player .  after jordan scored a playoff record points against the boston celtics on april ,  celtics star larry bird described him as god disguised as michael jordan .  with five regular season mvps tied for second place with bill russell only kareem abdul jabbar has won more ,  six ,  six finals mvps nba record ,  and three all star mvps ,  jordan is the most decorated player ever to play in the nba .  jordan finished among the top three in regular season mvp voting a record times ,  and was named one of the greatest players in nba history in .  he is one of only seven players in history to win an ncaa championship ,  an nba championship ,  and an olympic gold medal doing so twice with the and u . s .  men s basketball teams .  although jordan has done much to increase the status of the game ,  some of his impact on the game s popularity in america appears to be fleeting .  television ratings in particular increased only during his time in the league ,  and finals ratings have not returned to the level reached during his last championship winning season .  jordan s private jet features a stripe in carolina blue ,  the air jordan logo on the tail ,  and references to his career in the identification number .  in june ,  jordan was ranked by forbes magazine as the th most powerful celebrity in the world with million earned between june and june .  according to the forbes article ,  jordan brand generates billion in sales for nike .  in june ,  jordan was named the first nba player to become a billionaire ,  after he increased his stake in the charlotte hornets from to .  on january ,  jordan was honored with the charlotte business journal s business person of the year for .  as of november ,  his current net worth is estimated at .  billion by forbes .  jordan is the second richest african american in the world as of .  in poland ceased to exist as an sovereign nation and throughout the th century remained partitioned by degrees between prussian ,  austrian and russian empires .  not until the end of world war i was independence restored and the nation reunited ,  although the drawing of boundary lines was ,  of necessity ,  a contentious issue .  independent poland lasted for only years before it was again attacked and divided among foreign powers .  many places of learning and culture universities ,  schools ,  libraries ,  museums ,  theaters and cinemas were either closed or designated as nur fr deutsche for germans only .  twenty five museums and a host of other institutions were destroyed during the war .  according to one estimate ,  by war s end of the infrastructure of poland s educational and research institutions and of its museums had been destroyed .  according to another ,  only of pre war poland s museums survived the war ,  and just of these institutions were able to reopen .  of pre war poland s scientific institutions ,  about half were totally destroyed ,  and only a few survived the war relatively intact .  the state of polish primary schools was somewhat better in the general government ,  though by the end of ,  only of prewar schools were operational ,  and only of prewar polish children attended them .  a german police memorandum of august described the situation as follows the lead vessel of the class ,  ins arihant was launched in and after extensive sea trials ,  was confirmed as ready for operations on february .  arihant is the first ballistic missile submarine to have been built by a country other than one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council .  along with her three sister ships ,  knig ,  grosser kurfrst ,  and kronprinz ,  markgraf took part in most of the fleet actions during the war ,  including the battle of jutland on may and june .  at jutland ,  markgraf was the third ship in the german line and heavily engaged by the opposing british grand fleet she sustained five large caliber hits and her crew suffered casualties .  markgraf also participated in operation albion ,  the conquest of the gulf of riga ,  in late .  the ship was damaged by a mine while en route to germany following the successful conclusion of the operation .  after germany s defeat in the war and the signing of the armistice in november ,  markgraf and most of the capital ships of the high seas fleet were interned by the royal navy in scapa flow .  the ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the allied powers negotiated the final version of the treaty of versailles .  on june ,  days before the treaty was signed ,  the commander of the interned fleet ,  rear admiral ludwig von reuter ,  ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the british would not be able to seize the ships .  unlike most of the scuttled ships ,  markgraf was never raised for scrapping the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay .  she was armed with ten .  cm .  in sk l guns arranged in five twin gun turrets two superfiring turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels .  her secondary armament consisted of fourteen cm .  in sk l quick firing guns ,  six .  cm .  in sk l quick firing guns and five cm in underwater torpedo tubes ,  one in the bow and two on each beam .  markgraf s .  cm guns were removed and replaced with four .  cm anti aircraft guns .  the ship s main armored belt was millimeters in thick .  the deck was mm .  in thick the main battery turrets and forward conning tower were armored with mm in thick steel plates .  following her commissioning on october ,  markgraf conducted sea trials ,  which lasted until december .  by january ,  the ship had joined iii battle squadron of the high seas fleet with her three sister ships .  on january ,  iii squadron was detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver ,  gunnery ,  and torpedo training in the baltic .  the ships returned to the north sea on february ,  too late to assist the i scouting group at the battle of dogger bank .  around ,  several british destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the german line .  markgraf initially held her fire as the identities of the destroyers were unknown .  but gunners aboard grosser kurfrst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes ,  which prompted markgraf to follow suit .  heavy fire from the german battleships forced the british destroyers to withdraw .  at ,  markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine .  markgraf was never raised for scrapping ,  unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled .  markgraf and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships ,  which made any salvage attempt more difficult .  the outbreak of world war ii in put a halt to all salvage operations ,  and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical .  the rights to future salvage operations on the wrecks were sold to britain in .  owing to the fact that the steel that composed their hulls was produced before the advent of nuclear weapons ,  markgraf and her sisters are among the few accessible sources of low background steel ,  which has occasionally been removed for use in scientific devices .  markgraf and the other vessels on the bottom of scapa flow are a popular dive site ,  and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks .  across western europe ,  the early neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape .  these were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead ,  and though sometimes constructed out of timber ,  many were built using large stones ,  now known as megaliths .  individuals were rarely buried alone in the early neolithic ,  instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community .  the construction of these collective burial monumental tombs ,  both wooden and megalithic ,  began in continental europe before being adopted in britain in the first half of the fourth millennium bce .  they can be divided into two separate clusters one to the west of the river medway and the other on blue bell hill to the east ,  with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between and km .  the western group includes coldrum long barrow ,  addington long barrow ,  and the chestnuts long barrow .  the eastern group consists of kit s coty house ,  little kit s coty house ,  the coffin stone ,  and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs .  it is not known if they were all built at the same time ,  or whether they were constructed in succession ,  while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage .  it had been built using about stones .  the barrow is sub rectangular in plan ,  and about meters feet in length .  at its broader ,  eastern end ,  where the chamber is located ,  the monument measures metres feet ,  while at the narrower ,  western end ,  it is metres feet in breadth .  as such ,  the barrow is a truncated wedge shape .  the megalithic builders responsible for the coldrum stones positioned it on the top of a small ridge adjacent to the north downs ,  and constructed it facing eastward ,  towards the river medway .  the chamber of the monument measures .  metres feet in length ,  and .  metres feet inches in width ,  although it was potentially much larger when originally constructed .  the chamber s internal height would have been at least metres feet inches .  in its current state ,  the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs ,  one being feet long ,  feet ,  inches deep ,  and foot ,  inches thick ,  and the other feet long ,  feet deep ,  and feet thick .  conversely ,  the chamber s southern side consists of a single slab ,  measuring feet ,  inches in length ,  feet ,  inches in depth ,  and foot ,  inches in depth at its thicker ,  eastern end .  the western end of the chamber is closed off with a slab measuring about feet ,  inches wide ,  with a thickness of foot and a depth of around feet .  a collapsed ,  broken slab lies at the opening eastern end of the chamber .  it is also possible that a largely rectangular slab at the bottom of the slope had once been part of the eastern end of the chamber .  excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens twentieth century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement ,  allowing the stones to continue standing upright .  little is known about her activities after the end of the war other than she was redesignated as a training ship on may .  she was sunk as a target ship by ss n missiles on november .  route ,  also known as the colonel rodman highway ,  is a .  mile .  km long numbered state highway located in washington county and southern kent county ,  rhode island ,  united states .  the route is a major north south freeway in the southern providence metropolitan area ,  directly linking providence with eastern washington county ,  the beaches of narragansett and south kingstown ,  and the city of newport .  route begins as a two lane divided highway at an intersection with u . s .  route us in the town of north kingstown ,  becoming a limited access freeway after .  miles .  km .  the route has four numbered interchanges before terminating in the city of warwick ,  where the northbound lanes merge into interstate i .  the origins of route date back to ,  when construction began on a short ,  unnumbered arterial from us to the modern location of exit at routes and in wickford .  in ,  the rhode island department of public works began work on a .  mile .  km freeway from modern exit north to the merge with i .  the freeway ,  designated as route ,  was completed in .  at that time ,  the route designation was also applied to the wickford arterial .  in ,  the missing link in route between exits and was completed and opened .  the rhode island department of transportation has long term plans to upgrade the southernmost portion of route to freeway status by constructing overpasses at oak hill road and west allenton road and a grade separation with us .  although the project was originally scheduled to be completed by ,  the million project has been postponed indefinitely .  in ,  the rhode island general assembly passed a million equivalent to million in bond issue to fund the construction of a mile .  km ,  four lane divided arterial bypass of u . s .  route in wickford .  construction on the highway began in and was completed in ,  at which time the roadway opened as an unnumbered state highway leading from us to routes and in wickford .  construction of a .  mile .  km long section of route from what is now exit in east greenwich to i in warwick began in and was completed in .  that year ,  the mile .  km arterial south of the modern exit was also designated as part of route .  the divided highway remains largely intact to this date as the stretch of route from us to routes and at exit the only piece of the arterial that has been significantly altered is the construction of a bridge over amtrak s northeast corridor line .  by the early s ,  route was complete north of exit and south of what would become exit ,  but there was a still a missing piece in the highway between the two exits .  in the s ,  the state of rhode island faced several budget problems and environmental concerns ,  both of which delayed the construction of the missing link for nearly eleven years .  environmental studies on the missing link began in ,  and the state estimated that the .  mile .  km long section of freeway would cost million equivalent to million in to construct .  in ,  construction began on the quonset freeway ,  a relocated route that serves the quonset business park from route .  the project included the reconstruction and reworking of exit off route ,  which was a southbound only exit serving both route and route when constructed .  the exit was converted into a trumpet interchange with new ramps between route ,  route and route and was completed in december ,  one year ahead of schedule .  the project included the construction of a new northbound exit serving route east .  west end girls is a song by british pop duo pet shop boys .  written by neil tennant and chris lowe ,  the song was released twice as a single .  the song is influenced by hip hop music ,  with lyrics concerned with class and the pressures of inner city life which were inspired partly by t .  s .  eliot s poem the waste land .  it was generally well received by contemporary music critics and has been frequently cited as a highlight in the duo s career .  the song was performed by pet shop boys at the summer olympics closing ceremony and was included as part of the soundtrack of the game grand theft auto v on the non stop pop radio station .  in ,  neil tennant met producer bobby orlando ,  while on an assignment in new york interviewing sting for smash hits .  after listening to some demos ,  orlando offered to produce for the duo .  in april ,  west end girls was released ,  becoming a club hit in los angeles and san francisco ,  and a minor dance hit in belgium ,  and france ,  but was only

.  they re recorded west end girls with producer stephen hague ,  and re released the song in late ,  topping the charts in both the uk and the u . s .  the lyric from lake geneva to the finland station refers to the train route taken by vladimir lenin when he was smuggled by the germans to russia during world war i ,  a pivotal event in the russian revolution .  indeed ,  it is highly likely the lyric was inspired by the book to the finland station by edmund wilson ,  a very famous work on the history of revolutionary thought and socialism that tennant would have at least heard of ,  if not read ,  as a student .  the bobby orlando produced version of the single included another line ,  all your stopping ,  stalling and starting ,  who do you think you are ,  joe stalin ,  which was removed for the version .  in ,  west end girls won for best single at the brit awards ,  and for best international hit at the ivor novello awards .  in ,  the british academy of composers and songwriters gave to west end girls the ivor novello award for song of the decade between the years and .  having signed with emi ,  the group released their first major label single opportunities let s make lots of money in mid ,  but it failed to attract attention .  the pet shop boys then decided to re record west end girls ,  and issue this new version as a single .  producer stephen hague helmed the new ,  re recorded version of west end girls .  the re recorded version of west end girls was released in the united kingdom in october ,  debuting on the uk singles chart at number ,  and

in january .  across europe ,  west end girls also topped the singles chart in norway ,  as well as peaking in the top three in belgium ,  germany ,  ireland ,  the netherlands ,  sweden ,  and

pressure in the southeast gulf of mexico near the florida keys ,  and moved across the state of florida .  as it entered the warm waters of the gulf stream in the atlantic ocean ,  it began to rapidly intensify ,  exhibiting traits of a tropical system ,  including the formation of an eye .  it attained a pressure of millibars on december and ,  and after moving northward ,  it came ashore near new york city on christmas eve .  because of the uncertain nature of the storm ,  the national hurricane center nhc did not classify it as a tropical cyclone .  heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in south carolina .  much of the rest of the east coast was affected by high winds ,  coastal flooding ,  and beach erosion .  new york state and new england bore the brunt of the storm damage was extensive on long island ,  and in connecticut ,  households lost electric power during the storm .  widespread damage and power outages also occurred throughout

with palenque ,  its greatest rival and one of the most important polities in the west of the maya region ,  although tonin eventually became the dominant city in the west .  the city is notable for having the last known long count date on any maya monument ,  marking the end of the classic maya period in ad .  rulers of tonin recorded in the maya script on tonin monuments include the last known recorded date at the site is featured on monument as january ce .  tonin had a particularly active early classic presence ,  although the early classic remains lie entirely buried under later construction .  due to this ,  early texts are scarce and only offer a glimpse of the early history of the site .  an th century text refers to a king ruling in ad ,  although it only mentions his title ,  not his name .  the site is accessible for tourism and has a small museum that was inaugurated on july .  much of the public imagery of the site details the ruthless manner in which the city dealt with its enemies .  a by metres by ft stucco sculpture rising from the fourth to fifth terraces depicts a skeletal death god carrying the severed head of a lord of palenque in one hand .  a frieze on the fifth terrace probably displayed tonin s most distinguished victims ,  dozens of fragments of this frieze were discovered in the plaza below .  this frieze was carved from the local sandstone but its style is that of palenque ,  suggesting that captured artists carried out the work .  after the abandonment of the city at the end of the classic period ,  many of the sculptures fell down the steep embankment supporting the seven terraces .  the monuments of tonin tend to be smaller than those at other maya sites ,  with most of the stelae measuring less than metres .  ft tall .  the most important difference from monuments at other maya sites is that they are carved in the round like statues ,  often with hieroglyphic text running down the spine .  on the fifth terrace ,  in the round sculptures of tonin s rulers dominated two dimensional representations of defeated enemies .  the dated monuments at tonin span the period from ad to ,  covering most of the classic period .  monument was recovered from a school in ocosingo and moved to the site museum of tonin .  it is a badly eroded life size human statue with the head missing .  monument dates to the reign of ruler .  it marks the period ending of and shows the presentation of three war captives .  monument is an undated fragment that depicts a female captive ,  which is rare in maya art .  monument is the earliest securely dated monument at the site ,  dating to ad .  it depicts ruler .  monument depicts ruler participating in a scattering ritual .  although numbers have declined steeply in western europe ,  this bird is classed as least concern on the iucn red list because of its huge range and large ,  apparently stable ,  populations in russia and kazakhstan .  numbers in western china are more significant than previously thought ,  and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses .  despite its elusive nature ,  the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature ,  and garnered a range of local and dialect names .  nest success in undisturbed sites is high ,  at ,  but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land .  the method and timing of mowing is crucial mechanized mowing can kill of chicks in a given site ,  and losses average of first brood chicks and somewhat less than of second brood chicks .  the influence of weather on chick survival is limited although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather ,  the effects are relatively small .  unlike many precocial species ,  chicks are fed by their mother to a greater or lesser extent until they become independent ,  and this may cushion them from adverse conditions .  the number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather ,  with lower survival in large broods .  the annual adult survival rate is under ,  although some individuals may live for years .  until ,  despite a breeding range estimated at ,  km ,  sq mi ,  the corn crake was classified as near threatened on the iucn red list because of serious declines in europe ,  but improved monitoring in russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased .  it is therefore now classed as least concern ,  since the major populations in russia and kazakhstan are not expected to change much in the short term .  there are an estimated .  million breeding pairs in europe ,  three quarters of which are in european russia ,  and a further ,  pairs in asiatic russia the total eurasian population has been estimated at between .  and .  million individuals .  in much of the western half of its range ,  there have been long term declines that are expected to continue ,  although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries ,  including a five fold increase in finland ,  and a doubling in the uk .  in the netherlands ,  there were breeding territories in ,  but this number had increased to at least by .  most rails are secretive wetland birds that have made little cultural impression ,  but as a formerly common farmland bird with a loud nocturnal call that sometimes led to disturbed sleep for rural dwellers ,  the corn crake has acquired a variety of folk names and some commemoration in literature .  the symptoms of aml are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells ,  which causes a drop in red blood cells ,  platelets ,  and normal white blood cells .  these symptoms include fatigue ,  shortness of breath ,  easy bruising and bleeding ,  and increased risk of infection .  several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified ,  but the specific cause is not clear .  as an acute leukemia ,  aml progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated .  aml has several subtypes treatment and prognosis vary among subtypes .  aml is cured in of people less than years old and more than years old .  older people who are not able to withstand intensive chemotherapy have an average survival of months .  a number of risk factors for developing aml have been identified ,  including other blood disorders ,  chemical exposures ,  ionizing radiation ,  and genetics .  the who subtypes of aml are eight fab subtypes were proposed in .  the single most important prognostic factor in aml is cytogenetics ,  or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell .  certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes for example ,  the translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia .  about half of people with aml have normal cytogenetics they fall into an intermediate risk group .  a number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment .  acute myeloid leukemia is a relatively rare cancer .  there are approximately ,  new cases each year in the united states ,  and the incidence rate has remained stable from through .  aml accounts for .  of all cancer deaths in the united states .  the incidence of aml increases with age the median age at diagnosis is years .  aml accounts for about of all acute leukemias in adults ,  but is rare in children .  the rate of therapy related aml that is ,  aml caused by previous chemotherapy is rising therapy related disease currently accounts for about of all cases of aml .  aml is slightly more common in men ,  with a male to female ratio of .  there is some geographic variation in the incidence of aml .  in adults ,  the highest rates are seen in north america ,  europe ,  and oceania ,  while adult aml is rarer in asia and latin america .  in contrast ,  childhood aml is less common in north america and india than in other parts of asia .  these differences may be due to population genetics ,  environmental factors ,  or a combination of the two .  aml accounts for of all leukaemia cases in the uk ,  and around ,  people were diagnosed with the disease in .  in ,  aml became the first cancer genome to be fully sequenced .  dna extracted from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin .  the leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several genes that had not previously been associated with the disease .  digital download love me like you

center and one of the largest ports in the united states .  it was devastated by the galveston hurricane ,  whose effects included flooding and a storm surge .  the natural disaster on the exposed barrier island is still ranked as the deadliest in united states history ,  with an estimated toll of ,  people .  much of galveston s modern economy is centered in the tourism ,  health care ,

to protect the city from floods and hurricane storm surge .  a team of engineers including henry martyn robert robert s rules of order designed the plan to raise much of the existing city to a sufficient elevation behind a seawall so that confidence in the city could be maintained .  the city developed the city commission form of city government ,  known as the galveston plan ,  to help expedite recovery .  the end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island .  increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of las vegas ,  nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island .  finally in ,  texas attorney general will wilson and the texas rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city .  as these vice industries crashed ,  so did tourism ,  taking the rest of the galveston economy with it .  neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward .  with the s came the expansion of higher education in galveston .  already home to the university of texas medical branch ,  the city got a boost in with the creation of

made landfall on galveston island in the early morning of september ,  as a category hurricane with winds of miles per hour .  damage was extensive to buildings along the seawall .  after the storm ,  the island was rebuilt with further investments into tourism ,  shipping ,  and continued emphasis on higher education and health care .  notably the addition of the galveston island historic pleasure pier and the replacement of the bascule type drawbridge on the railroad causeway with a vertical lift type drawbridge to allow heavier freight .  the city of galveston is situated on galveston island ,  a barrier island off the texas gulf coast near the mainland coast .  made up of mostly sand sized particles and smaller amounts of finer mud sediments and larger gravel sized sediments ,  the

,  alan dershowitz ,  finkelstein s tenure bid at depaul was denied .  finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the academic year ,  and on september ,  he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms .  an official statement from depaul strongly defended the decision to deny finkelstein tenure ,  stated that outside influence played no role in the decision .  in ,  he was banned from entering israel for years .  citing linguist and political activist noam chomsky as an example ,  finkelstein notes that it is possible to unite exacting scholarly rigor with scathing moral outrage ,  and supporters and detractors alike have remarked on the polemical style of finkelstein s work .  its content has been praised by eminent historians such as raul hilberg and avi shlaim ,  as well as chomsky .  millions of people the world over ,  smothered by false history and propaganda ,  will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the palestinians .  finkelstein published portions of his thesis in the following publications a land without a people joan peters wilderness image ,  chapter of image and reality of the israel palestine conflict .  dershowitz threatened libel action over the charges in finkelstein s book ,  as a consequence of which ,  the publisher deleted the word plagiarism from the text before publication .  finkelstein agreed to remove the suggestion that dershowitz was not the true author of the case for israel because ,  as the publisher said ,  he couldn t document that .  in their joint interview on democracy now ,  however ,  finkelstein cited specific passages in dershowitz s book in which a phrase that he says peters coined was incorrectly attributed to george orwell responding to an article in the nation by alexander cockburn ,  dershowitz also cited the chicago manual of style cockburn s claim is that some of the quotes should not have been cited to their original sources but rather to a secondary source ,  where he believes i stumbled upon them .  even if he were correct that i found all these quotations in peters s book ,  the preferred method of citation is to the original source ,  as the chicago manual of style emphasizes with all reuse of others materials ,  it is important to identify the original as the source .  this .  helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism .  to cite a source from a secondary source quoted in .  is generally to be discouraged .  to which cockburn responded in an april ,  interview with the harvard crimson ,  dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last september to depaul faculty members lobbying against finkelstein s tenure .  when asked how he ,  as the son of holocaust survivors ,  felt about israel s operation in gaza ,  finkelstein replied finkelstein is an advocate of a two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict .  finkelstein argued one of israel s primary motivations for launching the offensive in gaza was that hamas was signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the june border .  finkelstein believes hamas had joined the international community in seeking a diplomatic settlement and describes hamas s stance towards israel prior to the war as a peace offensive .  in june ,  in an appearance on democracy now ,  finkelstein elaborated

under the orders of god ,  freed the israelites from physical slavery in egypt .  according to church teaching ,  god offered a covenant which included the ten commandments to also free them from the spiritual slavery of sin .  some historians have described this as the central event in the history of ancient israel .  according to catholic teaching ,  this commandment does not preclude the use of god s name in taking solemn oaths administered by legitimate authority .  however ,  lying under oath ,  invoking god s name for magical purposes ,  or voicing words of hatred or defiance against god are considered sins of blasphemy .  the catechism says this commandment requires duties of children to parents that include respect toward parents that also flows to brothers and sisters .  support that requires grown children to offer material and moral support for their aging parents ,  particularly at times of illness ,  loneliness ,  or distress .  keeping this commandment ,  according to the catechism ,  also requires duties of parents to children which include respect for their children as children of god and human persons .  being a good example to their children .  to practice charity ,  which is a necessity for any working family or society it is the greatest social commandment and requires people to love god and neighbor .  to welcome the foreigner who is in need of security and livelihood that cannot be found in his own country .  an obligation for rich nations to help poor nations ,  especially in times of immediate need .  an expectation for families to help other families .  the church requires all to pray and work to prevent unjust wars ,  but allows for just wars if certain conditions are met the reasons for going to war are defensive .  the damage inflicted by the aggressor .  must be lasting ,  grave ,  and certain .  it is a last resort taken only after all other means of putting an end to the grave damage have been ineffective .  the ultimate aim is peace and there is a serious chance of success .  the catechism lists the following offenses against chastity in increasing order of gravity lust the church teaches that sexual pleasure is good and created by god ,  who meant for spouses to experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit .  kreeft says ,  lust does not mean sexual pleasure as such ,  nor the delight in it ,  nor the desire for it in its right context .  lust is the desire for sexual pleasure alone ,  outside its intended purpose of procreation and the uniting of man and woman ,  body and soul ,  in mutual self donation .  according to the church ,  adultery and divorce are considered offenses against the dignity of marriage and are defined as follows in extreme situations ,  such as domestic violence ,  separation is allowed .  this is not considered a divorce and may be justified .  civil divorce is not a divorce according to the church .  if it is deemed to be the only way of ensuring legal rights ,  care of children ,  or protection of inheritance ,  the church considers it morally acceptable .  according to the church ,  people have a right to private property .  however ,  ownership makes that person a steward who is expected to make it fruitful or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family .  private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society .  the taking of another s private property in obvious and urgent necessity as the only way to provide for immediate ,  essential needs food ,  shelter ,  clothing is not considered by the church to be stealing .  the concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the church ,  which classifies it as the stealing of a person s human rights .  following acts are also considered as violation of the seventh commandment price manipulation to get advantage on the harm of others ,  corruption ,  appropriation of the public goods for personal interests ,  work poorly carried out ,  tax avoidance ,  counterfeiting of checks or any means of payment ,  any forms of copyright infringement and piracy ,  and extravagance .  purity of heart is suggested as the necessary quality needed to accomplish this task common catholic prayers and hymns include a request for this virtue .  the church identifies gifts of god that help a person maintain purity purity of intention ,  which seeks to fulfill god s will in everything ,  knowing that it alone will lead to the true end of man .  prayer that recognizes the power of god to grant a person the ability to overcome sexual desires .  technically ,  it is known as a speaker that easily reveals poor quality in recordings .  recording engineers sought to dull its treble response by hanging tissue paper in front of it ,  resulting in what became known as the tissue paper effect ,  a type of comb filtering .  the ns has been used to monitor a large number of successful recordings by numerous artists ,  leading gizmodo to refer to it as the most important loudspeaker you never heard of .  yamaha discontinued the product in .  recording studios around the world ,  particularly those specialising in rock and pop music ,  adopted the speaker as the standard .  in excess of ,  pairs were sold throughout the world .  gizmodo referred to it as the most important loudspeaker you never heard of .  the network is second order passive ,  crossing over at khz .  the frequency range is quoted from hz to khz ,  and rated power handling is w .  the early version of the speaker has press down type output terminals later models had screw terminals .  in simplistic terms ,  the ns possesses sonic characteristics that allow record producers to assume that if a recording sounds good on these monitors ,  then it should sound good on most playback systems .  whilst it can reveal any shortcomings in the recording mix as well as the monitoring chain ,  it may lead to listener fatigue with prolonged use in the domestic setting .  a report by newell et al .  at southampton university undertaken for studio sound in found that the ns had excellent time domain response at low frequencies its ability to start and stop in response to signal input was found to be superior to that of most other nearfield monitors .  part of this was related to its closed box design .  the researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments guitar and drums are correctly balanced in the mix .  there were many other versions of the ns ,  the best known of which were the ns m studio and the ns m pro ,  both introduced in .  technically identical to the studio ,  the pro comes fitted with a speaker grille and is meant to be used in a vertical orientation .  state route sr is a nearly .  mile long .  km state highway in the u . s .  state of utah ,  connecting sr in cornish ,  cache county to u . s .  route us near richmond via lewiston ,  in the extreme northern part of the state .  the highway has existed since at least ,  as sr since at least ,  and between and ,  vehicles travel along the highway on an average day in .  the highway s name changes from south to center street through lewiston .  passing the lewiston cemetery ,  sr crosses over the cub river and a second single track belonging to up ,  and then a third up single track just before the highway s eastern terminus at us north of richmond .  all of the rail lines that sr crosses originally belonged to the oregon short line railway .  aside from the segment through lewiston ,  the highway is surrounded by farmland for its entire journey across northern utah .  the entire route is in cache county .  between and ,  sweden built six hemmemas .  the hemmema became the largest and most heavily armed vessel in the archipelago fleet and served in the russo swedish war of .  oden ,  the first hemmema ,  was relatively small and very similar to a turuma ,  a different type of archipelago frigate .  russia built six hemmemas based on the swedish design between and after capturing three of the swedish vessels at the surrender of sveaborg in .  the later versions ,  both swedish and russian ,  were much larger and much more heavily armed than oden .  under the finnish form hmeenmaa ,  the name of the ship type was later carried on to several vessels of the th century finnish navy .  a graduate of the university of wisconsin madison ,  creutz helped princeton university build its first cyclotron .  during world war ii he worked on nuclear reactor design under eugene wigner at the metallurgical laboratory ,  designing the cooling system for the first water cooled reactors .  he led a group that studied the metallurgy of uranium and other elements used in reactor designs .  in october ,  he moved to the los alamos laboratory ,  where he became a group leader .  after the war ended ,  creutz accepted an offer to come to the carnegie institute of technology ,  where he became the head of its physics department and its nuclear research center in .  in he returned to los alamos to evaluate its thermonuclear fusion program for the atomic energy commission .  while there he accepted an offer to become vice president for research and development and the director of its john jay hopkins laboratory for pure and applied science at general atomics .  under his leadership ,  general atomics developed triga ,  a nuclear reactor for universities and laboratories .  wigner moved to princeton university in ,  and soon after creutz received an offer as well .  princeton had been given a inch mm magnet by the university of california

who were victorious in battle .  yue lives in a shed by his grave through the winter and in the second lunar month of the following year ,  his martial brothers come and pull the building down ,  forcing him to return home and take care of his mother .  the quoted death date is not only unreliable because the book is fiction ,  but also because the xuan he reign era of emperor huizong lasted only seven years and not seventeen .  although the story of yue fei states zhou died shortly before yue took a wife ,  he historically died after yue married .  it is likely that the original author invented this fictional date .  the water margin c .  is a ming dynasty military romance about one hundred and eight demons born men and women who band together to rebel against the lavish song

numerous islands ,  most of which only recorded minor impacts .  large swells and heavy rains impacted the abc islands .  antigua and barbuda sustained million in damages ,  mainly on antigua as nine homes were destroyed ,  several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters .  one person died in puerto rico after suffering a stress induced cardiac arrest .  the united states virgin islands also sustained significant damage ,  costing roughly million .  numerous boats and homes were damaged and over power poles were snapped .  total losses from the storm were estimated at million .  on september ,  a well developed tropical wave moved off the eastern coast of africa and entered the atlantic ocean .  deep convection formed around a prominent mid level circulation as it moved towards the west .  however ,  the convection diminished on october before entering the caribbean sea a week later .  upon entering the caribbean sea ,  shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low .  continued development followed and the low was designated as tropical depression fifteen at utc on october while located about miles kilometres south of the southeastern tip of the dominican republic .  the previous steady westward motion that the system took across the atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two .  as the structure of the storm improved ,  it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the national hurricane center nhc gave it the name omar .  located to the southeast of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the west of a low to mid level ridge ,  omar took a counter clockwise turn on october .  upon becoming a tropical storm ,  omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation .  wind shear around the storm ,  which was previously inhibiting quick development ,  weakened ,  allowing for further strengthening .  later that day ,  an .  to .  mi .  to .  km wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough .  with the formation of an eye ,  the dvorak technique rendered an intensity of mph km h ,  signifying that omar had intensified into a hurricane .  the intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical .  however ,  deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared puerto rico .  shortly after ,  the eye quickly became well defined and appeared on visible satellite images ,  an indication the storm was intensifying .  the chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well developed outflow and prominent banding features .  with very warm sea surface temperatures ,  high ocean heat content ,  low wind shear ,  and a moist air mass ,  omar quickly reached its peak intensity early on october as a category hurricane with winds of mph km h .  during the intensification phase ,  the forward motion of the hurricane increased to mph km h .  once in the atlantic ocean ,  omar began to rapidly weaken ,  with winds decreasing by mph km h in hours .  visible satellite images depicted an exposed low level circulation with convection displaced to the east due to a combination of very high wind shear and dry air .  by october ,  most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated however ,  a brief decrease in wind shear allowed omar to re strengthen to its secondary peak ,  with winds of mph km h .  during this phase ,  convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed .  later that day ,  the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed omar ,  leading to decreasing movement .  a weakening storm ,  omar continued towards the northeast due to a mid to upper level ridge located south of the system and the mid latitude westerlies to the north .  late on october ,  wind shear increased once more as omar tracked over waters below c f .  around utc on october ,  omar weakened to a tropical storm as deep convection associated with it dissipated .  twelve hours later ,  while still producing tropical storm force winds ,  the storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area .  the remnants of omar persisted until utc on october when it dissipated about mi ,  km west of the azores .  omar produced moderate damage throughout numerous islands ,  amounting to at least million usd and one death was related to the storm .  in puerto rico ,  a man died after he collapsed from cardiac arrest while trying to install storm shutters on his home .  as a tropical wave ,  the precedent to omar produced heavy rains over the island ,  causing minor flooding .  after passing by puerto rico a second time ,  omar produced locally heavy rains ,  which caused minor street flooding .  on st .  croix ,  waves up to ft .  m from omar sank about boats ,  leading to a large oil spill around the islands .  about ships broke lose from the docks ,  of which lost their anchors .  omar produced upwards of in .  mm of rain on the island within a hour span .  although st .  croix was brushed by the eyewall ,  sustained winds reached mph km h with gusts to mph km h .  three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink .  most of the islands ,  residents were without power as over utility poles were destroyed .  damages on the island were estimated at ,  with another million in clean up costs .  st .  thomas ,  one of the hardest hit islands ,  was left completely without power in the wake of the hurricane .  all of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or without power .  damages on the island totaled to .  million .  on dominica ,  omar s close pass to the island left families homeless and severely hampered the fishing community .  on december ,  the board of directors of the caribbean development bank approved .  million for assistance to those affected by omar on the island and to restore the infrastructure damaged by the hurricane .  on december ,  the government of dominica invested million in aid for the fishing communities impacted by omar .  a total of fishermen were provided with per week for a total of four weeks .  sixty two of which continued to receive funds due to their circumstances .  the government also purchased boat engines to distribute to fishers .  another ,  was spent to repair boats and construct another that had been damaged or destroyed by omar .  the government also bought replacement fishing gear .  forty six out of fifty seven cardinals participated in the conclave the spanish and neapolitan governments had

club played at west hendford on an irregular basis during the late th century ,  but returned in ,  by which time they only played rugby ,  and had changed their name accordingly to yeovil rugby club .  in ,  the cricket club committee announced that there was provision for a longer lease ,  of five or seven years ,  and that they would make improvements to the ground to enable it to host first class cricket .  the ground was also used for field hockey in the early th century ,  hosting a yeovil hockey club .  new year s eve received mostly positive reviews from critics .  according to the

zombies allow people to deal with their own anxiety about the end of the world .  brooks has expressed a deep fear of zombies sentence spacing is the horizontal space between sentences in typeset text .  it is a matter of typographical convention .  since the introduction of movable type printing in europe ,  various sentence spacing conventions have been used in languages with a latin alphabet .  these include a normal word space as between the words in a sentence ,  a single enlarged space ,  and two full spaces .  until the th century ,  publishing houses and printers in many countries used additional space between sentences .  there were exceptions to this traditional spacing method some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than word spacing .  this was french spacing a term synonymous with single space sentence spacing until the late th century .  with the introduction of the typewriter in the late th century ,  typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters .  while wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid twentieth century ,  the practice continued on typewriters and later on computers .  perhaps because of this ,  many modern sources now incorrectly claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter .  the desired or correct sentence spacing is often debated but many sources now say additional space is not necessary or desirable .  from around ,  single sentence spacing became standard in books ,  magazines and newspapers and the majority of style guides that use a latin derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence .  however ,  some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable .  the debate continues on the world wide web .  many people prefer double sentence spacing for informal use because that was how they were taught to type .  there is a debate on which convention is more readable the few recent direct studies conducted since have produced inconclusive results .  modern style guides provide standards and guidance for the written language .  these works are important to writers since virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication .  late editions of comprehensive style guides ,  such as the oxford style manual in the united kingdom and the chicago manual of style in the united states ,  provide standards for a wide variety of writing and design topics ,  including sentence spacing .  the majority of style guides now prescribe the use of a single space after terminal punctuation in final written works and publications .  a few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work ,  and the gregg reference manual makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences .  web design guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic ,  as html refuses to recognize double spaces altogether .  these works themselves follow the current publication standard of single sentence spacing .  microsoft word does not treat sentences differently by default ,  but the grammar checking can be set to prefer a specific number of spaces between sentences .  most style guides indicate that single sentence spacing is proper for final or published work today ,  and most publishers require manuscripts to be submitted as they will appear in publication single sentence spaced .  writing sources typically recommend that prospective authors remove extra spaces before submitting manuscripts ,  although other sources state that publishers will use software to remove the spaces before final publication .  l . a . m

watson agrees that the proper result of a perfectly played chess game .  is a draw .  of course ,  i can t prove this ,  but i doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree .  i remember kasparov ,  after a last round draw ,  explaining to the waiting reporters well ,  chess is a draw .  world champion bobby fischer thought that was almost definitely so .  berliner s thesis ,  like adams ,  has been sharply criticized .  as explained below ,  chess theorists in recent decades have continued to debate the size and nature of white s advantage ,  if any .  apart from berliner ,  they have rejected the idea that white has a forced win from the opening position .  many also reject the traditional paradigm that black s objective should be to neutralize white s initiative and obtain equality .  rowson argues that both white and black have certain advantages an examination of reversed and symmetrical openings illustrates white s and black s respective advantages the opening of the following game between two world class players ,  another symmetrical english ,  took a similar course in chess tournaments and matches ,  the frequency with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration .  in matches ,  the players colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots ,  and alternated thereafter .  in round robin tournaments with an odd number of players ,  each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks with an even number of players ,  each receives one extra white or black .  where one or more players withdraws from the tournament ,  the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites ,  or vice versa .  the double round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings ,  since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks ,  and plays both white and black against each opponent .  jonathan rowson has speculated that in principle it should be possible for a machine to .  develop piece tablebases .  this may take decades or even centuries ,  but unless runaway global warming or nuclear war gets in the way ,  i think it will eventually happen .  however ,  information theorist claude shannon argued that it is not feasible for any computer to actually do this .  in his paper programming a computer for playing chess he writes it is thus theoretically possible to solve chess ,  determining with certainty whether a perfectly played game should end in a win for white ,  a draw ,  or even a win for black .  however ,  according to shannon the time frame required puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology .  a graduate of the stevens institute of technology and new york university ,  reines joined the manhattan project s los alamos laboratory in ,  working in the theoretical division in richard feynman s group .  he became a group leader there in .  he participated in a number of nuclear tests ,  culminating in his becoming the director of the operation greenhouse test series in the pacific in .  reines sang in a chorus ,  and as a soloist .  for a time he considered the possibility of a singing career ,  and was instructed by a vocal coach from the metropolitan opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them .  the family later moved to north bergen ,  new jersey ,  residing on kennedy boulevard and th street .  because north bergen did not have a high school ,  he attended union hill high school in union hill ,  new jersey ,  from which he graduated in .  from an early age ,  reines exhibited an interest in science ,  and liked creating and building things .  he later recalled that e according to fermi s theory ,  there was also a corresponding reverse reaction ,  in which a neutrino combines with a proton to create a neutron and a positron in ,  reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for the new university of california ,  irvine uci ,  becoming its first dean of physical sciences .  at uci ,  reines extended the research interests of some of his graduate students into the development of medical radiation detectors ,  such as for measuring total radiation delivered to the whole human body in radiation therapy .  federal ,  state ,  and local governments began construction in of barriers to protect the city .  the project included a levee of ,  feet ,  m and a flood wall of ,  feet m along the susquehanna river and bald eagle creek ,

income for the city was about ,  and about percent of lock haven s residents lived below the poverty line .  by ,  the lumber industry had declined ,  and the city s economic base rested on other industries ,  including a furniture factory ,  a paper mill ,  a fire brick plant ,  and a silk mill .  in ,  the piper aircraft corporation ,  maker of the piper cub and other light aircraft ,  moved its production plant to lock haven .  it remained one of the city s biggest employers until the s ,  when ,  after major flood damage and losses related to hurricane agnes in ,  it moved to florida .  the loss of piper aircraft contributed to an unemployment rate of more than in lock haven in the early s ,  though the rate had declined to about by .  another large plant ,  the paper mill that had

.  many of the al husn s roughly ,  muslim residents benefit economically from the tourism generated by the site .  when the outer walls were built in the th century the main entrance was enhanced .  a vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast .  the corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length ,  making it an example of a bent entrance .  bent entrances were a byzantine innovation ,  but that at krak des chevaliers was a particularly complex example .  it extended for metres ft ,  and along its length were murder holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles .  anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle s two circuits of walls .  to access the inner ward ,  the passage had to be followed round .  the successful opening night marked the climax of wilde s career but also heralded his downfall .  the marquess of queensberry ,  whose son lord alfred douglas was wilde s lover ,  planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show .  wilde was tipped off and queensberry was refused admission .  soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court ,  where wilde s homosexual double life was revealed to the victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment .  his notoriety caused the play ,  despite its early success ,  to be closed after performances .  after his release ,  he published the play from exile in paris ,  but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work .  the importance of being earnest has been revived many times since its premiere .  it has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions .  in the importance of being earnest ,  dame edith evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of

show .  wilde and alexander learned of the plan ,  and the latter cancelled queensberry s ticket and arranged for policemen to bar his entrance .  nevertheless ,  he continued harassing wilde ,  who eventually launched a private prosecution against the peer for criminal libel ,  triggering a series of trials ending in wilde s imprisonment for gross indecency .  alexander tried ,  unsuccessfully ,  to save the production by removing wilde s name from the billing ,  but the play had to close after only performances .  a collected edition of wilde s works ,  published in and edited by robert ross ,  helped to restore his reputation as an author .  alexander presented another revival of the importance at the st james s in ,  when he and aynesworth reprised their original roles the revival ran for performances .  max beerbohm said that the play was sure to become a classic of the english repertory ,  and that its humour was as fresh then as when it had been written ,  adding that the actors had worn as well as the play .  as wilde s work came to be read and performed again ,  it was the importance of being earnest that received the most productions .  by the time of its centenary the journalist mark lawson described it as the second most known and quoted play in english after hamlet .  in the abbey theatre ,  dublin ,  produced the play with an all male cast it also featured wilde as a character the play opens with him drinking in a parisian caf ,  dreaming of his play .  the melbourne theatre company staged a production in december with geoffrey rush as lady bracknell .  the play is set in the present i . e .  algernon moncrieff s flat in half moon street ,  w the play repeatedly mocks victorian traditions and social customs ,  marriage and the pursuit of love in particular .  in victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over riding societal value ,  originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes ,  it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century .  the play s very title ,  with its mocking paradox serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies ,  introduces the theme ,  it continues in the drawing room discussion ,  yes ,  but you must be serious about it .  i hate people who are not serious about meals .  it is so shallow of them ,  says algernon in act allusions are quick and from multiple angles .  in ,  erik chisholm composed an opera from the play ,  using wilde s text as the libretto .  it was adapted for australian tv in .  mathews returned to the african mainland territories once more in when he landed with a force which intended to establish further garrisons there to dissuade german territorial claims .  this attempt ultimately failed when five german warships steamed into zanzibar town harbour and threatened the sultan into signing away the territories which would later form german east africa .  further territories were ceded to the german east africa company in but unrest amongst the locals against them prevented them from taking control and mathews was dispatched with men to restore order .  finding around ,  people gathered against the german administrators mathews was forced to return with his men to zanzibar .  he landed once again with more troops but found himself subject to death threats and that his troops would not obey his orders and so returned again to zanzibar .  boreas displaced ,  long tons ,  t at standard load and ,  long tons ,  t at deep load .  the ship had an overall length of feet .  m ,  a beam of feet inches .  m and a draught of feet

where she served with the th greek destroyer flotilla for the rest of the war .  the ship was used as a training ship after the war until she was returned to the royal navy at malta on october .  salamis arrived at rosyth under tow on april to be broken up by metal industries ,  limited .  throughout the th and th centuries ,  horses were harvested from the feral herds and used as riding and stock horses ,  as well as being used for their meat ,  hair and hides .  originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the british crown and the native mori ,  but many were eradicated with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses .  kaimanawa horses today have the highest amount of genetic similarity with the thoroughbred and other thoroughbred cross breeds .  the album received mixed reviews from contemporary critics ,  but some noted how gaga was able to sell the songs from

in the u . s .  since the spanish armament of ,  the royal navy had been at sea in a state of readiness for over three years .  the navy s dockyards under first lord of the admiralty charles middleton were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict .  this was quite unlike the disasters of the american revolutionary war ten years earlier ,  when an ill prepared royal navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the north american campaign which ended in defeat at the battle of yorktown due to lack of supplies .  with british dockyards now readily turning out cannon ,  shot ,  sails ,  provisions and other essential equipment ,  the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the navy list .  taking the bait ,  the following day howe attacked again ,  but his attempt to split the french fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship ,  hms caesar ,  failed to follow orders .  much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive ,  and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue .  howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage ,  enabling him to further attack villaret at a time of his choosing .  three french ships were sent back to port with damage ,  but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained the following day with the arrival of nielly s detached squadron .  battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog ,  but when the haze lifted on june ,  the battle lines were only miles km apart and howe was prepared to force a decisive action .  howe and queen charlotte led the fleet by example ,  sailing directly at the french flagship montagne .  passing between montagne and the next in line vengeur du peuple ,  queen charlotte raked both and hauled up close to montagne to engage in a close range artillery battle .  as she did so ,  queen charlotte also became briefly entangled with jacobin ,  and exchanged fire with her too ,  causing serious damage to both french ships .  having escaped to the east ,  villaret made what sail his battered fleet could muster to return to france ,  and dispatched his frigates in search of the convoy .  villaret was also hoping for reinforcements eight ships of the line ,  commanded by admiral pierre franois cornic ,  were patrolling near the ushant headland .  behind him to the west ,  the british took the whole night to secure their ships and prizes ,  not setting out to return to britain until on june .  casualties in the battle are notoriously hard to calculate exactly .  with only one exception scipion ,  records made by the french captains of their losses at the time are incomplete .  the only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of saint andr and the records made by british officers aboard the captured ships ,  neither of which can be treated as completely reliable .  most sources accept that french casualties in the campaign numbered approximately ,  including around ,  captured ,  but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details .  british casualties are easier to confirm but here ,  too ,  there are some discrepancies overall british casualties are generally given as around ,  .  both britain and france claimed victory in the battle britain by virtue of capturing or sinking seven french ships without losing any of her own and remaining in control of the battle site france because the vital convoy had passed through the atlantic unharmed and arrived in france without significant loss .  the two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting .  the british fleet in spithead was treated with a royal visit by king george iii and the entire royal household .  new york state

objectors with an alternative to military service during world war ii .  from to ,  nearly ,  draftees ,  willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service ,  accepted assignments in work of national importance in cps camps throughout the united states and puerto rico .  draftees from the historic peace churches and other faiths worked in areas such as soil conservation ,  forestry ,  fire fighting ,  agriculture ,  under the supervision of such agencies as the u . s .  forest service ,  the soil conservation service ,  and the national park service .  others helped provide social services and mental health services .  the cps men served without wages and minimal support from the federal government .  the cost of maintaining the cps camps and providing for the needs of the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families .  cps men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well after the end of the war .  initially skeptical of the program ,  government agencies learned to appreciate the men s service and requested more workers from the program .  cps made significant contributions to forest fire prevention ,  erosion and flood control ,  medical science and reform of the mental health system .  conscientious objectors cos refuse to participate in military service because of belief or religious training .  during wartime ,  this stance conflicts with conscription efforts .  those willing to accept non combatant roles ,  such as medical personnel ,  are accommodated .  there are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in any way .  as the united states prepared for another war ,  the historic peace churches ,  represented by friends who understood inner dealings of washington d . c .  politics ,  attempted to influence new draft bills to ensure their men could fulfill their duty in an alternative ,  non military type of service .  on june ,  the burke wadsworth bill came before congress .  the arrangements for conscientious objectors were almost identical to the world war i provisions .  the friends representatives continued attempting to make the bill more favorable to the historic peace churches .  the burke wadsworth bill passed on september ,  becoming the selective training and service act of .  the influence of the churches was evident in section g ,  which says in part any such person claiming such exemption from combatant training and service .  in lieu of such induction ,  be assigned to work of national importance under civilian direction .  sunday worship services were organized by the camp director if he was a pastor ,  by a visiting pastor ,  or by the cps men themselves .  while the historic peace churches organized the cps ,  of the men came from other denominations and claimed no religious affiliation .  men with wives and dependents found it difficult to support their families .  beyond a small allowance ,  the men did not get paid for their service ,  nor were their dependents given an allowance .  to be closer to their husbands ,  women sought employment near their husband s assignment .  later ,  when jobs on dairy farms became available ,  families could live together in housing provided for farm workers .  churches were primarily responsible for financing civilian public service ,  providing for the men s food ,  clothes ,  and other material needs .  the churches also provided and paid for the camp director .  the men received an allowance of between .  and .  monthly for personal needs .  when jobs were available in surrounding farms and communities ,  those willing to work beyond their regular cps jobs could earn extra spending money .  the federal government spent .  million on the cps program .  the men performed million of unpaid labor in return .  the first civilian public service projects were in rural areas where the men performed tasks related to soil conservation ,  agriculture and forestry .  later men were assigned to projects in cities where they worked in hospitals ,  psychiatric wards ,  and university research centers .  the cps men discovered appalling conditions in the mental hospital wards .  in an interview ,  a conscientious objector described his experience when he first entered a mental hospital in october one objector assigned to a violent ward refused to take the broomstick offered by the charge .  when he entered the ward the patients crowded around asking ,  where is your broomstick ,  he said he thought he would not need it .  but suppose some of us gang up on you ,  the co guessed they wouldn t do that and started talking about other things .  within a few days the patients were seen gathering around the unarmed attendant telling him of their troubles .  he felt much safer than the charge who had only his broomstick for company .  and the governor came in and they cleaned out the hospital .  i mean ,  they had hearings .  we all had to appear in court and all that kind of stuff .  and within a month or so ,  the hospital was completely changed .  the superintendent was fired and the new superintendent was put in ,  and not only did they do our hospital ,  they did all the hospitals ,  mental hospitals in virginia .  it couldn t happen today .  internal review boards would not permit the use of a live virus in human subjects unless they really understood what was going to happen to them .  and i doubt that even if they knew what the risk was ,  that an internal review board in any academic institution would consent to that kind of experimental work .  irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures ,  especially in the fields of literature .  alongside mainstream western culture ,  a strong indigenous culture exists ,  as expressed through gaelic games ,  irish music ,  and the irish language .  the culture of the island also shares many features with that of great britain ,  including the english language ,  and sports such as association football ,  rugby ,  horse racing ,  and golf .  during the iron age ,  a celtic language and culture emerged in ireland .  how and when the island of ireland became celtic has been debated for close to a century ,  with the migrations of the celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies .  today ,  there is more than one school of thought on how this occurred in ireland .  the title of king of ireland was re created in by henry viii ,  then king of england ,  of the tudor dynasty .  english rule of law was reinforced and expanded in ireland during the latter part of the th century ,  leading to the tudor conquest of ireland .  a near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the th century ,  following the nine years war and the flight of the earls .  aside from the development of the linen industry ,  ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution ,  partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of england ,  which saw ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital .  the state was neutral during world war ii ,  but offered clandestine assistance to the allies ,  particularly in the potential defence of northern ireland .  despite their country s neutrality ,  approximately ,  volunteers from independent ireland joined the british forces during the war ,  four being awarded victoria crosses .  large scale emigration marked most of the post wwii period particularly during the s and s ,  but beginning in the economy improved ,  and the s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth .  this period of growth became known as the celtic tiger .  the republic s real gdp grew by an average of .  per annum between and ,  in which year the republic joined the euro .  in ,  it was the sixth richest country in the world in terms of gdp per capita .  social changes also occurred in this time ,  most markedly with the decline in authority of the catholic church .  the financial crisis that began in dramatically ended this period of boom .  gdp fell by in and by .  in ,  the worst year since records began although earnings by foreign owned businesses continued to grow .  the state has since experienced deep recession ,  with unemployment ,  which doubled during ,  remaining above in .  in the late s ,  nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests ,  which were often confronted by loyalist counter protests .  the government s reaction to confrontations was seen to be one sided and heavy handed in favour of unionists .  law and order broke down as unrest and inter communal violence increased .  the northern ireland government requested the british army to aid the police ,  who were exhausted after several nights of serious rioting .  in ,  the paramilitary provisional ira ,  which favoured the creation of a united ireland ,  emerged from a split in the irish republican army and began a campaign against what it called the british occupation of the six counties .  the assembly and power sharing executive were suspended several times but were restored again in .  in that year the british government officially ended its military support of the police in northern ireland operation banner and began withdrawing troops .  on june ,  northern ireland s deputy first minister and former ira commander ,  martin mcguinness ,  shook hands with queen elizabeth ii in belfast ,  symbolising reconciliation between the two sides .  both the republic of ireland and the united kingdom are members of the european union ,  and as a consequence there is free movement of people ,  goods ,  services and capital across the border .  the republic today ranks amongst the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of gdp per capita and in was ranked the seventh most developed nation in the world by the united nations human development index .  a period of rapid economic expansion from onwards became known as the celtic tiger period ,  was brought to an end in with an unprecedented financial crisis and an economic depression in .  ultimately political power is held by the uk government ,  from which northern ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended .  northern ireland elects of the uk house of commons mps .  the northern ireland secretary is a cabinet level post in the british government .  along with england ,  wales and scotland ,  northern ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the uk ,  all of which share the supreme court of the united kingdom as their court of final appeal .  as part of the good friday agreement ,  the british and irish governments agreed on the creation of all island institutions and areas of cooperation .  the north south inter parliamentary association is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of ireland .  it has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures .  there are two multi city regions on the island of ireland dublin belfast corridor .  m cork limerick galway corridor m below is a comparison of the regional gdp on the island of ireland .  precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall ,  particularly in the east .  the west tends to be wetter on average and prone to atlantic storms ,  especially in the late autumn and winter months .  these occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas ,  as well as sometimes snow and hail .  the regions of north county galway and east county mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island ,  with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas .  munster ,  in the south ,  records the least snow whereas ulster ,  in the north ,  records the most .  inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter .  usually around days of the year are below freezing c f at inland weather stations ,  compared to days at coastal stations .  ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves ,  most recently in ,  and .  in common with the rest of europe ,  ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of .  temperatures fell as low as .  c f in county mayo on december and up to a metre ft of snow fell in mountainous areas .  world heritage sites the island has been invaded by some algae ,  some of which are now well established .  for example the population of ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the th century .  a population of over million in was reduced to slightly more than million by .  in part ,  the fall in population was due to death from the great famine of to ,  which took about million lives .  however ,  by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the st century .  emigration from ireland in the th century contributed to the populations of england ,  the united states ,  canada and australia ,  where a large irish diaspora lives .  as of ,  .  million canadians ,  or of the population ,  are of irish descent .  as of ,  a total of .  million americans claim irish ancestry .  with growing prosperity since the last decade of the th century ,  ireland became a destination for immigrants .  since the european union expanded to include poland in ,  polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants over ,  from central europe .  there has also been significant immigration from lithuania ,  the czech republic and latvia .  the irish language has a vast treasure of written texts from many centuries ,  and is divided by linguists into old irish from the th to th century ,  middle irish from the th to th century ,  early modern irish until the th century ,  and the modern irish spoken today .  it remained the dominant language of ireland for most of those periods ,  having influences from latin ,  old norse ,  french and english .  it declined under british rule but remained the majority tongue until the early th century ,  and since then has been a minority language ,  although revival efforts are continuing in both the republic of ireland and northern ireland .  religion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times and since the th century plantations ,  has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island .  ireland s pre christian heritage fused with the celtic church following the missions of saint patrick in the th century .  the hiberno scottish missions ,  begun by the irish monk saint columba ,  spread the irish vision of christianity to pagan england and the frankish empire .  these missions brought written language to an illiterate population of europe during the dark ages that followed the fall of rome ,  earning ireland the sobriquet ,  the island of saints and scholars .  ireland has nine universities ,  seven in the republic of ireland and two in northern ireland ,  including trinity college ,  dublin and the university college dublin ,  as well as numerous third level colleges and institutes and a branch of the open university ,  the open university in ireland .  in ,  fifa directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and ,  in ,  directed that the fai s team be known only as republic of ireland and that the ifa s team be known as northern ireland with certain exceptions .  northern ireland qualified for the world cup finals in reaching the quarter finals ,  and .  the republic qualified for the world cup finals in reaching the quarter finals ,  and the european championships in and .  across ireland ,  there is significant interest in the english and ,  to a lesser extent ,  scottish soccer leagues .  horse racing and greyhound racing are both popular in ireland .  there are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well attended .  the island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs .  the horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the county kildare .  the obsolete destroyer hms campbeltown ,  accompanied by smaller craft ,  crossed the english channel to the atlantic coast of france and was rammed into the normandie dock gates .  the ship had been packed with delayed action explosives ,  well hidden within a steel and concrete case ,  that detonated later that day ,  putting the dock out of service for the remainder of the war and up to five years after .  combined operations examined a number of options while planning the destruction of the dock .  at this stage of the war the british government still tried to avoid civilian casualties .  this ruled out a bombing attack by the raf ,  which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of civilian life .  the special operations executive were approached to see if its agents could destroy the dock gates .  they decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them .  the royal navy was also unable to mount an operation ,  as st nazaire is km miles up the loire estuary .  any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range .  the planners then examined whether a commando force was feasible to accomplish the task .  an unusually high spring tide was due in march which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks ,  bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel .  the approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship ,  but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through .  the purpose of the raid was to destroy three objectives the normandie dock ,  the old gates into the bassin de st nazaire together with the water pumping machinery and other installations ,  and any u boats or other shipping in the area .  the initial combined operations plan required two specially lightened destroyers to carry out the raid .  the first would be packed with explosives and rammed into the dock gates .  commandos on board would then disembark and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations ,  searchlights and gun emplacements .  the destroyer would then be blown up ,  and the second ship would come in and evacuate the ship s crew and the commandos .  at the same time the raf would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area .  combined operations headquarters worked closely with several intelligence organisations to plan the raid .  the naval intelligence division compiled information from a variety of sources .  a detailed plan of the town of st nazaire was provided by the secret intelligence service ,  and information on the coastal artillery nearby was sourced from the war office s military intelligence branch .  intelligence about the dock itself came from pre war technical journals .  the man selected to lead the commando force was lieutenant colonel charles newman his no .  commando would provide the largest commandos contingent ,  men ,  for the raid .  the special service brigade headquarters used the raid to provide experience for their other units and men were drawn from nos ,  and commandos .  there were only two other mls in the vicinity ml had continued past the dock and was engaging targets upriver ,  ml appeared to be out of control and was running in circles .  by this time the crew of campbeltown had detonated the scuttling charges and gathered at the rear of the ship to be taken off .  ml came alongside the destroyer and took men on board including beattie and some of the wounded .  major copland went through campbeltown and evacuated the wounded towards the old mole ,  not knowing that there were no other boats there to take the commandos off .  some commandos were still ashore when newman realised that evacuation by sea was no longer an option .  he gathered the survivors and issued three orders to do our best to get back to england not to surrender until all our ammunition is exhausted not to surrender at all if we can help it .  newman and copland led the charge from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and advanced into the new town .  the commandos attempted to get through the narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside ,  but were eventually surrounded .  when their ammunition was expended their only option was to surrender .  not all the commandos were captured five men reached neutral spain ,  from where they eventually returned to england .  ml ,  the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from campbeltown ,  was sunk on her way out of the estuary .  ml ,  another torpedo armed boat ,  had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw german fire away from the landings .  soon after passing campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged .  it took ten minutes to repair the steering .  they turned and started in the other direction ,  opening fire on an armed trawler in passing .  return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire .  after the commando headquarters group had landed ,  commander ryder went to check for himself that campbeltown was firmly stuck in the dock .  some of her surviving crewmen were being taken on board the mgb .  ryder returned to the boat and ordered the mtb to carry out its alternative task and torpedo the lock gates at the old entrance to the basin .  after a successful torpedo attack ,  ryder ordered the mtb to leave .  on their way out of the estuary they stopped to collect survivors from a sinking ml and were hit and set on fire .  back at the docks the mgb had positioned itself in mid river to engage enemy gun emplacements .  the forward pounder was manned by able seaman william alfred savage .  commander ryder reported that ryder could see no ships other than seven or eight burning mls .  he then realised that the landing places at the old mole and the entrance to the basin had both been recaptured by the germans .  there was nothing more they could do for the commandos ,  so they headed out to sea .  on their way they were continuously illuminated by german searchlights and were hit at least six times by the

true to most adventure game conventions ,  voyage has some unique features for its genre .  these include two dexterity minigames which take advantage of the reduced gravity in the game s lunar setting ,  and an intelligence management system ,  in which a score is assigned to the player for every puzzle he solves ,  and for certain actions .  the adventure company introduced this feature to motivate players to replay the game to increase their cumulative score .  voyage features two unique dexterity minigames .  using a low gravity setting ,  the first minigame requires the player to collect floating bubbles in a can ,  and the second requires the player to execute large jumps across the surface of the moon .  these two minigames form only a minor part of the game .  the game also has several timed sequences requiring the player to complete puzzles under a time limit .  the consequence of failing a puzzle of this sort is death ,  after which the player is able to return and replay the puzzle .  players can also be killed as the result of taking incorrect actions related to the game s story .  a critical aspect of gameplay in voyage is the inventory system ,  which allows the player to pick up and keep dozens of different items .  however ,  the maximum quantity of a given item that the player may keep in his inventory at any one time is three .  one of the main uses of the inventory is to combine items together to make new items .  this process of breaking and reforming items in the inventory comprises a large portion of the puzzle aspect of the game .  the inventory can also be used to create meals which the player can consume this ability plays a major role in several puzzles .  another use of the inventory is to create hybrid lunar plants ,  which play a critical role in the earlier puzzles of the game .  voyage is set in .  president barbicane of the gun club decides to build an enormous cannon in baltimore to shoot a shell ,  capable of supporting human life ,  towards the moon in the hopes of a successful landing .  voyage s protagonist ,  michel ardan ,  volunteers to travel in the aluminium shell .  after the game s brief introduction in the shell ,  ardan lands on the moon and discovers the selenites ,  as well as a complex ecosystem of lunar plants .  the main accessible areas in the game are the moon s surface ,  and the underground selenite civilization .  journey to the center of the moon was announced for the pc at e .  the adventure company collaborated with developers kheops studios for the release .  benot hozjan ,  the co founder of kheops studio ,  became managing director of the game ,  while alexis lang became the lead game designer .  journey to the center of the moon was later renamed voyage inspired by jules verne .  benot hozjan explained the change ,  saying that journey to the center of the moon seems to be confusing and some people thought that it could be the sequel to journey to the center of the earth ,  another verne inspired pc game ,  so marketing decided to change it .  the name was changed on july ,  a few months after the game s announcement .  old baltimore pike is a road in the u . s .  state of delaware .  the road ,  known as new castle county road ,  runs from maryland route md at the maryland state line south of newark ,  delaware and continues east to christiana ,  ending near delaware route de .  the road is paralleled by interstate i ,  delaware turnpike to the north and u . s .  route us ,  pulaski highway to the south .  the old baltimore pike was built before and connected elkton ,  maryland to christiana .  it was a turnpike called the elk and christiana turnpike between and .  in the past it served as a major connection between philadelphia and baltimore .  the road ,  also known as old post road ,  was incorporated in as the elk and christiana turnpike in order to get more money for repairs .  the turnpike was completed in april .  as a turnpike ,  tolls were collected to pay for the maintenance of the road .  the construction of the new castle and frenchtown railroad lowered the revenues of the turnpike and it became a public road again in .  the road historically went through agricultural areas however ,  the surroundings have become more developed over the years .  much of the old baltimore pike remains two lanes .  the entire route is in new castle county .  after defeating the evil dr .  wily many times ,  the robotic hero mega man is called into action once again when a powerful being known as king steals the blueprints to the creations of dr .  wily and dr .  light in order to create an army for robotic dominance over humans .  having learned of the threat ,  mega man s rival bass decides to take matters into his own hands .  the game is an action platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons .  mega man bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters ,  each of which plays differently from the other .  the gameplay in mega man bass is similar to earlier games in the series .  the player is tasked with completing a series of action platform stages while overcoming obstacles ,  solving minor puzzles ,  and battling enemies .  destroying the robot master boss at the end of a stage lets the player acquire its special weapon .  in previous games ,  the player generally took on the role of the hero mega man .  in this game ,  the player can choose to start the game as either mega man or bass .  however ,  whichever character is picked must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed .  mega man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground .  bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in eight directions ,  though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained .  bass is also able to double jump jump a second time in mid air and dash along the ground .  performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances by doing a dash jump .  mega man bass was originally available in japan through the nintendo power game service in lawson convenience stores .  its popularity prompted capcom to later release the game in super famicom cartridge form .  until its gba re release ,  it was one of the few mega man titles not localized for english speaking countries .  the company commemorated the th anniversary of the mega man franchise with the gba version of the game .  elements of the game appeared in the mega man comic series from archie comics before it went on hiatus .  most notably ,  king appeared during a time travel story in issue ,  while issue saw dr .  light experiencing a vision of the events of the game among other yet to be adapted games .  state route sr is a very short ,  two lane state highway in the western portion of the u . s .  state of ohio .

western terminus at its junction with sr .  sr was established in the early s .  it started out as a much longer highway ,  but earlier segments would become a part of sr in the late s .  for its entire length ,  sr runs along the boundary between darke county on the south side and mercer county on the north side .  sr begins in downtown burkettsville at a former railroad grade just west of washington street .  known as main street within burkettsville ,  the route runs due east through the village s central business district prior to entering a residential area where it intersects a few

the lords to veto money bills completely ,  and replaced a right of veto over other public bills with a maximum delay of two years .  it also reduced the maximum term of a parliament from seven years to five .  the bill was also an attempt to place the relationship between the house of commons and house of lords on a new footing .  as well as the direct issue of money bills ,  it set new conventions about how the power the lords continued to hold would be used .  it did not change the composition of the lords ,  however .  it was used in relation to the government of ireland act ,  which had been under the threat of a lords veto ,  now removed .  ulster protestants had been firmly against the passing of the bill .  however ,  it never came into force because of the outbreak of the first world war .  amendments to the parliament act were made to prolong the life of the parliament following the outbreak of the first world war and parliament because of the second world war .  these made special exemptions to the requirement to hold an election every five years .  it is also mentioned in discussion of constitutional convention .  whilst it replaced conventions regarding the role of the house of lords ,  it also relies on several others .  section only makes sense if money bills do not arise in the house of lords and the provisions in section only if proceedings on a public bill are completed in a single session ,  otherwise they must fail and be put through procedure again .  zoe williams also reviewed the restaurant shortly after it arrived in london ,  for the

after .  up jack got ,  and home did trot ,  with vinegar and brown paper .  by the early th century this had been modified in some collections ,  such as l .  e .  walter s ,  mother goose s nursery rhymes london ,  to up jack got and home did trot ,  and went to bed and bound his head with vinegar and brown paper .  to see jack s paper plaster for laughing at jack s disaster .  twentieth century versions of this verse include to see jack s paper plaster for causing jack s disaster .  it has also been suggested that the rhyme records the attempt by king charles i to reform the taxes on liquid measures .  he was blocked by parliament ,  so subsequently ordered that the volume of a jack pint be reduced ,  but the tax remained the same .  this meant that he still received more tax ,  despite parliament s veto .  hence jack fell down and broke his crown many pint glasses in the uk still have a line marking the pint level with a crown above it and jill came tumbling after .  the reference to jill actually a gill ,  or pint is said to reflect that the gill dropped in volume as a consequence .  the entire route is in miami dade county .  all exits are unnumbered .  nesbitt is married to

personnel by december ,  strong german defences had stalled canadian forces in ortona and british and new zealand forces in orsogna .  although both ortona and villa grande were captured by the end of december ,  general exhaustion among the allied forces prevented the capture of orsogna and an advance to pescara .  when harsh winter weather set in ,  it became clear to the allied generals that no further progress would be made and alexander called off the offensive .  montgomery s plan was for the canadian division to attack across the moro in the coastal lowlands to take ortona first and then pescara .  inland ,  in the jagged hills above the headwaters of the moro ,  the relatively fresh nd new zealand division would attack toward orsogna ,  while between these two the th indian infantry division would hold the centre of the front in a relatively static role .  on december ,  canadian forces began a series of large scale assaults on major crossing points along the moro river with the objective of securing a large bridgehead along the defensive line .  three primary points of attack were chosen villa rogatti ,  along the western edge of the canadian sector san leonardo ,  km .  mi south of ortona and san donato ,  a small town near the italian coast .  five primary infantry battalions were selected to assault these positions with the objective of crossing the moro river .  the offensives were scheduled to start on the morning of december .  by mid morning ,  german counterattacks on ppcli positions in the town had begun ,  involving tanks from the th company of the th panzer regiment .  panzer regiment ,  field guns and substantial infantry forces .  throughout the afternoon two infantry companies of the ppcli fought off several attacks by german forces ,  eventually managing to push them back to the vineyards on the northern edge of the town .  while the ppcli had taken casualties ,  german casualties were estimated at .  however ,  three strong german formation surrounded the canadian positions at villa rogatti ,  rendering further exploitation of the bridgehead unlikely .  col .  ware was advised to be ready to withdraw across the moro river ,  should german forces counterattack .  in order to allow the canadian division a greater concentration of force ,  on the night of december ,  the indian st infantry brigade from the indian th infantry division amalgamated the western flank of the st canadian division into their own lines .  as a result of the withdrawal ,  canadian efforts would focus on achieving a bridgehead at san leonardo .  the canadian attack on san leonardo by the seaforth highlanders of canada began late on december with a company establishing a bridgehead across the moro ,  taking heavy casualties .  in the early morning of december ,  a company was withdrawn and two additional seaforth companies resumed the offensive .  as ppcli secured and held their bridgehead over the moro river ,  the seaforth highlanders were struggling to enter san leonardo .  by ,  a single objective had been taken ,  with canadian units pinned down by well coordinated defensive fire from several companies of the st regiment .  simultaneously ,  small arms fire prevented c company from moving up the road from the moro to san leonardo ,  while d company remained on the southern banks of the moro throughout the early morning .  while attempts were made to cross the moro at san leonardo and villa rogatti ,  the hastings and prince edward regiment launched an attack on the moro river defences at the small coastal hamlet of san donato at on december .  however ,  the single rifle company making the attack achieved little territorial gain and lieutenant colonel kennedy commander of the hastings prince edward regiment ordered a withdrawal at .  throughout december ,  strong german coastal defences would prevent further advancement ,  despite the incorporation of tanks and artillery into the assault .  by nightfall ,  the german defenders still possessed control of san donato ,  with the hastings and prince edward regiment withdrawing to the southern bank of the moro river .  on december ,  major general vokes devised a new plan for taking the moro river .  while the th highlanders of canada and princess patricia s canadian light infantry resumed the assault on san leonardo from the southwest side of the town ,  the royal canadian regiment rcr would break out of the bridgehead created by the hastings and prince edward regiment ,  then move southwest towards san leonardo to link up with the th and ppcli .  the operation was scheduled to start on the afternoon of december .  as the th highlanders secured their positions west of san leonardo ,  the royal canadian regiment was involved in intense fighting southwest of san donato .  two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared german defences of the th panzergrenadier regiment .  a company was quickly tied down by german mortar fire ,  while b company flanked german positions to the north of san donato .  by nightfall ,  all four companies held tenuous positions in the thick of german defences .  on the night of december ,  the rcr was subjected to counterattacks by the th panzergrenadier regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous canadian artillery shelling .  with the indian division committed ,  montgomery decided to raise the stakes further by bringing the british th infantry division from the relatively tranquil xiii corps front in the high mountains on the left wing of the th army and insert them between the new zealand and indian divisions .  this would allow the indian division to narrow and concentrate their attack and give montgomery four divisions to continue the attack between orsogna and the sea .  by december ,  the british th infantry brigade the first of th division s brigades was in place and under the new zealand division s command .  once th division headquarters and its other brigades had arrived ,  these two left hand divisions were to be organised under the command of xiii corps ,  commanded by lieutenant general miles dempsey .  operation florence had come to an end .  while the german line had been pushed back and they had sustained casualties they could ill afford ,  they still firmly held orsogna .  furthermore ,  the new zealand division was ,  for the time being ,  fought out and needed a period of consolidation and reorganisation .  in preparation for what he hoped would be the final attack on the gully ,  vokes shifted the nd canadian infantry brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the st brigade .  vokes planned for an attack by the carleton and york regiment to be the last of the frontal assaults against the gully .  should this attack fail ,  the st brigade s seaforth highlanders and the royal canadian regiment would move through casa berardi and outflank german defences ,  forcing a withdrawal from the gully .  at on december ,  two companies of the carleton and york regiment attacked .  after little more than an hour of fighting ,  however ,  the canadians were forced to call the attack off .  in the afternoon ,  the two heavily depleted companies of the royal e rgiment fought off a large german counterattack on casa berardi ,  with the royal canadian horse artillery firing ,  rounds in support of canadian forces .  berkley warren bedell born march ,  is a former u . s .  representative from iowa .  after starting a successful business in his youth ,  berkley fly co ,  he ran for the united states congress in ,  but was defeated by incumbent wiley mayne .  in ,  however ,  bedell beat wiley mayne and was elected to congress .  he was known for his support of representative democracy and his populist style .  for example ,  he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide what he would do in congress on their behalf .  these meetings helped bedell understand the problems of his constituents as a result ,  he backed issues that were important to his farming constituency ,  such as waterway usage fees and production constraints .  during his time at congress ,  bedell took efforts to uphold representative democracy .  he held town halls regularly with his constituents ,  and he would let them vote on motions to decide what he would do in congress on their behalf .  this type of communication told bedell of the types of issues affecting his farming constituency .  thus ,  though bedell had not farmed in his life ,  he would take steps in congress to benefit farmers .  bedell sponsored several bold initiatives during his tenure in the united states house of representatives .  one initiative ,  which came from his constituents problems with the barge industry ,  focused on waterway usage fees .  he introduced legislation in that would require the barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which ,  bedell pointed out ,  the government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain .  bedell s original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the government spent on waterway projects .  this would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects ,  and it was the same plan proposed by pete domenici in the senate .  on the other hand ,  opponents of the bedell plan had a very different view of this legislation .  representatives such as pat roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office ,  and this bill was an example of the politicians not doing their jobs .  the reagan administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls ,  and the president

episode was written by bill oakley and josh weinstein ,  and directed by wes archer .  the writing staff wanted to do an episode where the simpsons family traveled to australia ,  because they thought everyone in australia had a good sense of humor and that they would get the jokes .  the staff had previously poked fun at several american institutions on the show and they thought it would be interesting to poke fun at a whole nation .  they designed australia and the australian people very inaccurately and many things were completely made up for fun .  the animators ,  however ,  got two australian tourist guides to help them out with the design of the australian landscape and buildings ,  as well as the american embassy .  the writers did research on the coriolis effect for this episode .  lisa s explanation of the effect is incorrect it affects global weather patterns and is caused by the spinning of the globe on its axis .  the amount of water in a toilet or sink is much too small to be affected by it .  in ,  fox studios australia in sydney used a different version of bart vs .  australia as part of their simpsons attraction ,  called the simpsons down under .  they

episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics .  in a dvd review of the sixth season ,  ryan keefer said all the australian jabs you expect to have here are present .  bart s

variety series called the jacksons .  the shows premiered in june ,  and featured all of the siblings excluding jermaine ,  who had chosen to stay with motown .  the initial series run of the minute programs was four weeks .  due to ratings success ,  more episodes were ordered in january .  the shows marked the first time that an african american family had ever starred in a television series .  the run of programs concluded shortly afterward .  following years of preparation ,  jackson s debut album centipede was distributed in october by cbs records ,  who had signed her as a solo artist two years previously .  the album was only released once the singer had ensured that family life was secure and that she had spent time with her children during their important younger years .  centipede became a moderate chart success ,  reaching number on billboard s top r b hip hop albums chart and number on its top .  the recording of the album had been a family affair it involved

defense forces .  development of a third generation vehicle based on the new jeep wrangler jk has been completed and significant production for both israeli and foreign customers is under way .  the two production frame lengths ,  .  and .  metres .  ft ,  the latter of which was among the few such jeep derivatives in production in recent years ,  were both available in civilian and military models .  aside from the israeli market ,  storms have long been exported to countries in south america ,  asia ,  and africa .  a jeep managed production line in egypt ,  whose vehicles are used by the egyptian armed forces ,  was absorbed into the ail storm production after it closed in .  as with several analogous light military vehicles ,  despite being originally designed to fill a light reconnaissance role ,  the rise of urban warfare and close quarters combat meant that the israel defense forces had to recast the storm in new roles .  the commander version incorporates a door hard

august and september .  throughout the year ,  fourteen tropical cyclones formed ,  of which nine reached tropical storm intensity six were hurricanes .  none of the hurricanes reached major hurricane intensity .  tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes ,  especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration ,  may have remained undetected .  because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the s ,  historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable .  as a result of a reanalysis project which analyzed the season in ,  an additional hurricane was added to hurdat .  the year s first tropical storm formed on may off the northern coast of hispaniola .  at the time ,  this was a rare occurrence ,  as only four other tropical disturbances were known to have formed prior during this period since then ,  reanalysis of previous seasons has concluded that there were more than four tropical cyclones in may before .  the season s final system was a tropical disturbance situated in the greater antilles ,  which dissipated on november .  on august ,  an extratropical cyclone developed into a tropical depression off the west coast of florida .  initially a weak disturbance ,  it moved generally westward ,  slowly gaining in intensity .  early on august ,  the depression attained tropical storm intensity .  ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested .  after reaching hurricane strength on august south of the mississippi river delta ,  the storm strengthened further into a modern day category hurricane ,  with maximum sustained winds of mph and a minimum barometric pressure of mbar hpa .  inhg at utc on august .  the hurricane moved ashore near sabine pass ,  texas later that day at peak strength .  once inland ,  the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened ,  degenerating into a tropical storm on august before dissipating over arkansas on august .  poems .  and line my sense ,  as though of hemlock i had drunk ,  o for a draught of vintage ,  that hath been that i might drink ,  and

in on their zoo tv tour approached by aid worker bill carter about bringing attention to the siege of sarajevo ,  the band conducted nightly satellite transmissions with bosnians during their shows .  these link ups were the subject of criticism from journalists for mixing entertainment with human tragedy .  although the war made it impractical for u to visit sarajevo at the time ,  they vowed to eventually play a concert in the city .  after the conflict ended in november ,  they made arrangements to visit sarajevo ,  and with help from united nations ambassadors and peacekeeping troops ,  they scheduled and played the concert in .  bono agreed to carter s request without asking the rest of the band ,  and when informed of the idea ,  the other members gave only tacit approval .  they briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city ,  with bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where carter and his friends hid during the siege .  he said ,  even if all we get is some extra attention for bosnia on mtv ,  that s something .  the idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible ,  as the only way into sarajevo was on a united nations plane .  manager paul mcguinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert ,  it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the zoo tv crew .  as he explained ,  u s effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that u is also obliged to resolve that issue .  going to sarajevo seems to me to fall into that category .  i think it would endanger the people we go with ,  endanger the tour ,  and endanger the band .  drummer larry mullen ,  jr .  feared that the move would look like a publicity stunt .  the peaceful nature of the u concert was fleeting ,  as violence flared up in the region the following year with the kosovo war .  nato troops remained in

mountain was relocated in amid fears that another slide was possible .  the town s population nearly doubled its pre slide population by ,  but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in .  the community is now part of the municipality of crowsnest pass in the province of alberta and has a population around .  the site of the disaster ,  which remains nearly unchanged since the slide ,  is now a popular tourist destination .  it has been designated a provincial historic site of alberta and is home to an interpretive centre that receives over ,  visitors annually .  the slide created two new peaks on the mountain the south peak stands ,  metres ,  ft high and the north peak ,  metres ,  ft .  geologists believe that another slide is inevitable ,  though not imminent .  the south peak is considered the most likely to fall it would likely create a slide about one sixth the size of the slide .  the mountain ,  continuously monitored for changes in stability ,  has been studied on numerous occasions .  the alberta geological survey operates a state of the art monitoring system used by researchers around the world .  over monitoring stations have been placed on the face of the mountain to provide an early warning system for area residents in case of another slide .  secondary structure regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds .  the most common examples are the helix ,  sheet and turns .  because secondary structures are local ,  many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule .  the molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates .  although enzymes can consist of hundreds of amino acids ,  it is usually only a small fraction of the residues that come in contact with the substrate ,  and an even smaller fraction three to four residues on average that are directly involved in catalysis .  the region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site .  a vast array of computational methods have been developed to analyze the structure ,  function ,  and evolution of proteins .  human protein atlas human protein

best day ,  best way .  she mentioned that she sang that song in a way that she felt the conflicts that were present in the story and with the strength that was part of the show s theme .  with regards to the song s music video ,  she wanted to have a video which would express in color emotions ,  such as the use of red to represent confrontations ,  black to represent the feeling of being lost ,  and green for frightening things .  in making the single bright flight l .  miranic ,  she mentions in an interview with hmv japan that the concept of the single is that it can be divided into two parts pink and black .  pink is the color of bright flight ,  a song which is in a pop style and was written in a cute image in mind ,  while black is the color of l .  miranic ,  which is in a dark rock style and has the theme of a bad woman .  lisa mentioned that the name l .  miranic was chosen because the song is linked to criminals and that since miranic is a name in some countries ,  adding her name to miranic to make lisa miranic would mean that the criminal in the song is her .  the discography of lisa includes three studio albums ,  one extended play ,  ten singles ,  and five

narrow bars to touch her father ,  lulu suddenly pulled her away .  but patty s arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke .  it was a freak accident .  no one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm .  pattycake s mother lulu died in early .  you re gonna love tomorrow is the fifth season premiere episode of the american comedy drama series desperate

basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly canadian point of view .  as the head of the university of toronto s political economy department ,  he worked to build up a cadre of canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on british or american trained professors unfamiliar with canada s history and culture .  he was successful in establishing sources of financing for canadian scholarly research .  innis attended the one room schoolhouse in otterville and the community s high school .  he travelled miles km by train to woodstock ,  ontario ,  to complete his secondary education at a baptist run college .  he intended to become a public school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training ,  but decided to take a year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an ontario teachers college .  at age ,  therefore ,  he returned to the one room schoolhouse at otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher .  the experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small ,  rural school was not for him .  innis s war was over .  his biographer ,  john watson ,  notes the physical wound took seven years to heal ,  but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime .  innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service .  watson also notes that the great war influenced innis s intellectual outlook .  it strengthened his canadian nationalism sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology ,  including the communications media that were used so effectively to sell the war and led him ,  for the first time ,  to doubt his baptist faith .  everywhere innis went his methods were the same he interviewed people connected with the production of staple products and listened to their stories .  harold innis s interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study ,  the fur trade in canada an introduction to canadian economic history .  the book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early th century to the s .  instead of focusing on the heroic european adventurers who explored the canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done ,  innis documents how the interplay of geography ,  technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and canada s political and economic destiny .  he concludes that the fur trade largely determined canada s boundaries adding that the country emerged not in spite of geography but because of it .  unlike many historians who see canadian history as beginning with the arrival of europeans ,  innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of first nations peoples .  we have not yet realized ,  he writes ,  that the indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of canadian institutions .  although innis remains appreciated and respected for the grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories ,  he was not without critics .  particularly ,  the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in empire and communications has been criticized as ambiguous ,  aggressively non linear ,  and lacking connections between levels of analysis .  biographers have suggested that this style may have been a result of innis illness late in his career .  innis s reputation as a public intellectual was growing steadily and ,  in ,  premier angus l .  macdonald invited him to serve on a royal commission to examine nova scotia s economic problems .  the next year ,  he helped establish the canadian journal of economics and political science .  in ,  he was appointed a full university of toronto professor and a year later ,  became the head of the university s department of political economy .  innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that instead ,  they should devote themselves ,  first to research on public problems ,  and then to the production of knowledge based on critical thought .  he saw the university ,  with its emphasis on dialogue ,  open mindedness and skepticism ,  as an institution that could foster such thinking and research .  the university could provide an environment ,  he wrote ,  as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state ,  so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives .  in the s ,  harold innis reached the height of his influence in both academic circles and canadian society .  in ,  he helped establish the american based economic history association and its journal of economic history .  he later became the association s second president .  innis played a central role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research the canadian social science research council and the humanities research council of canada .  innis s theories of political economy ,  media and society remain highly relevant he had a profound influence on critical media theory and communications and ,  in conjunction with mcluhan ,  offered groundbreaking canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change .  together ,  their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation .  the most significantly affected area was veracruz ,  where damage reached over billion pesos million usd .  most of it came from road damage in the state s northern portion ,  although there were also hundreds of damaged houses .  between veracruz and neighboring hidalgo ,  there were ,  people affected across municipalities .  overall there were six deaths in the country ,  one in veracruz and five in puebla .  in the latter state ,  a family of three perished in a landslide .  upon developing ,  the depression was located in an area of weak steering currents ,  resulting in an erratic movement generally to the south .  in its formative stages ,  the depression executed a small loop .  as it did so ,  it moved into an area of very warm waters and decreasing wind shear .  the depression s convection gradually organized ,  although the winds were slower to increase .  an anticyclone became established over the system ,  and the depression intensified into tropical storm lorenzo at around utc on september .  at the time ,  it was located about mi km east of tuxpan ,  veracruz ,  moving steadily westward under the influence of a building ridge to its east .  as it approached the coast ,  lorenzo rapidly intensified unexpectedly ,  and within hours of attaining tropical storm status it strengthened into a hurricane .  overall ,  the hurricane affected ,  people across veracruz and hidalgo ,  prompting the declaration of a state of emergency in municipalities .  the declaration allowed the usage of emergency resources for the affected people .  there were a total of six deaths in the country ,  five of which in puebla .  by about three days after the storm ,  all schools were reopened .  the mexican government distributed food ,  water ,  and construction materials for the areas most affected in veracruz .  following the storm ,  about power workers were dispatched in veracruz to restore electricity in the affected areas .  cadmium is created via the long s process in low medium mass stars with masses of .  to solar masses ,  taking thousands of years .  in that process ,  a silver atom captures a neutron and then undergoes beta decay .  the british geological survey reports that in ,  china was the top producer of cadmium with almost one sixth of the world s production ,  closely followed by south korea and japan .  cadmium is a common component of electric batteries ,  pigments ,  coatings ,  and electroplating .  cadmium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors ,  acting as a very effective neutron poison to control neutron flux in nuclear fission .  when cadmium rods are inserted in the core of a nuclear reactor ,  cadmium absorbs neutrons preventing them from creating additional fission events ,  thus controlling the amount of reactivity .  the pressurized water reactor designed by westinghouse electric company uses an alloy consisting of silver ,  indium ,  and cadmium .  cadmium can be used to block calcium channels in chicken neurons .  analytical methods for the determination of cadmium in biological samples have been reviewed .  tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population .  an estimated of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking .  absorption of cadmium through the lungs is more effective than through the gut ,  and as much as of the cadmium inhaled in cigarette smoke may be absorbed .  on average ,  cadmium concentrations in the blood of smokers is times times greater and in the kidney ,  times greater than non smokers .  despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke ,  there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from passive smoking .  using tactics first developed against the japanese in new guinea during the second world war ,  the australians gained the advantage of the high ground and assaulted the chinese positions from unexpected directions .  they then repelled repeated chinese counterattacks aimed at re capturing maryang san ,  with both sides suffering heavy casualties before the australians were finally relieved by a british battalion .  however ,  with the peace talks ongoing ,  these operations proved to be last actions in the war of manoeuvre ,  which had lasted the previous sixteen months .  it was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences reminiscent of the western front in .  a month later ,  the chinese subsequently re captured maryang san from the british during fierce fighting ,  and it was never re gained .  today ,  the battle is widely regarded as one of the australian army s greatest accomplishments during the war .  given the primary task of capturing hill ,  hassett studied the approaches from the air and the ground .  two previous attempts to take maryang san by american troops had been unsuccessful .  regardless ,  utilising tactics first developed against the japanese in new guinea during the second world war of running along the tops of ridges ,  he intended to gain the advantage of the high ground ,  while utilising the cover afforded by the vegetation and the ease of movement along the crest lines ,  in order to assault the chinese positions from unexpected directions .  meanwhile ,  the chinese defenders on maryang san were also testing a newly developed tactic called the mobile positional defense ,  in which only small units were stationed on the hills in order to exhaust the un attackers ,  while the bulk of the chinese defenders would later counterattack before the un forces could consolidate into their newly gained positions .  at on october ,  b company rar moved north ,  metres ,  yd toward hill ,  crossing the open valley under the cover of darkness and heavy mist .  a company then moved up behind c company .  artillery and mortar fire targeted known chinese artillery positions with counter battery fire prior to dawn ,  before switching to support the borderers in their assault on hill .  simultaneously ,  the shropshires were assaulting hill and with the support of a squadron ,  th royal irish hussars they reached the positions without opposition by .  by b company had gained the high ground to the north and then proceeded to patrol the short distance to west to the objective which was then taken with three wounded five chinese were killed and one captured .  by mid morning ,  both the shropshires and the australians had successfully captured their objectives .  given the strong resistance exhibited by the chinese ,  the canadians expected a tough fight as th brigade prepared to assault its objectives as part of the second phase of the divisional plan .  yet with the loss of hill and the chinese unexpectedly withdrew from their well prepared defensive positions ,  with hill and captured without opposition .  only the nd battalion ,  princess patricia s canadian light infantry encountered any opposition before they captured the two hill features ,  losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which chinese were also killed .  indeed ,  the ease with which the canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on ,  attaining their final objectives on the jamestown line by nightfall .  no further resistance was encountered ,  although heavy chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties ,  including three killed .  the canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty two months of fighting .  meanwhile ,  on the th brigade s left flank the shropshires met slight resistance ,  securing hill southwest of kowang san by .  they were then relieved by the canadians by nightfall in preparation for the third phase of the operation .  the brigade plan was now a day behind schedule ,  although with the unexpected ease experienced by the canadians ,  overall ,  the divisional attack was still running according to plan .  however ,  determined to hold on following the loss of hill ,  the chinese moved in fresh troops ,  heavily reinforcing a number of positions ,  including maryang san .  earlier that morning ,  at ,  b and d companies rar had moved north across the valley ,  while anti tank platoon crossed the imjin ,  taking up positions further north in order to protect the right flank .  the assaulting companies would then move west towards a series of objectives before assaulting hill .  initially rar was to attack from the east ,  while rnf would attack from the southwest through hill ,  however with the fusiliers facing stiff resistance on hill itself they were unable to get forward to assist .  the previous attempts to capture maryang san had failed due to the approach to steep eastern slopes of the feature being across a wide ,  open valley that was dominated by enfilade fire from mutually supporting chinese positions .  consequently ,  the australians planned to cross the valley under cover of darkness and position themselves on the chinese flank in the foothills ,  before scaling the position at first light .  a company would create a diversion on the left flank ,  while b company would clear the lower slopes before d company passed through to assault the chinese main defensive position ,  known as the victor feature ,  in a one up ,  one in depth assault .  however ,  following the casualties of previous nights on hill ,  and ,  and the effect of constant shelling ,  rar was now reduced to just men .  in contrast ,  the australians faced two fresh chinese battalions on maryang san ,  in total about ,  men .  with both sides exhausted from the fighting the night of october was less eventful than expected ,  and the australians used the opportunity to develop their position .  to add further depth to their defences and to probe the chinese positions ,  taylor ordered the australians to capture the central remaining chinese position ,  the sierra feature a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of maryang san and the hinge the next day .  meanwhile ,  the fusiliers would renew their attack on hill .  the southern approach to hill had proved to be too strongly defended by the chinese and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders .  to do this the high ground to the north west of maryang san ,  known as the hinge ,  would be vital .  indeed ,  adjacent to hill ,  the hinge dominated it from the north .  as such for the next assault ,  planned for the morning ,  the fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the hinge from the east ,  using the australian positions on maryang san as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on hill .  four hours later ,  at ,  rar was relieved on maryang san and the hinge by the borderers ,  having lost killed and wounded .  chinese casualties on hill had been severe ,  with at least killed determined by body count and another captured ,  while hundreds more were thought likely to have been killed and wounded .  later it was estimated that the australians had destroyed at least two chinese battalions during the five day battle .  rnf once more advanced against hill ,  this time without opposition ,  sending patrols to confirm that the chinese had withdrawn .  they were met by patrols from kosb on the hinge ,  with the borderers taking control of the area at .  hill was latter occupied on october by the borderers .  the rar assault pioneer platoon ,  the anti tank platoon and a platoon from c company remained on maryang san however ,  and during the evening of october the pioneers killed four chinese during a probe on their position .  they were finally relieved on october .  for his leadership ,  hassett was immediately awarded the dso ,  while a number of awards were also made to others that had distinguished themselves during the fighting .  the royal australian regiment was subsequently granted the battle honours kowang san and maryang san .  today ,  the first battle of maryang san is widely regarded as one of the australian army s greatest accomplishments of the korean war .  indeed ,  the evacuation of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic ,  and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters on a number of occasions ,  resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition .  meanwhile ,  the quality of support given to the british and australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor .  indeed ,  the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited ,  while the new zealand gunners had fired over ,  rounds in direct support of rar ,  blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns .  air support ,  including that provided by the south african mustangs ,  had been important throughout .  tennyson completed the poem on october ,  but it was not published until ,  in his second collection of poems .  unlike many of tennyson s other important poems ,  ulysses was not revised after its publication .  tennyson originally blocked out the poem in four paragraphs ,  broken before lines ,  and .  in this structure ,  the first and third paragraphs are thematically parallel ,  but may be read as interior and exterior monologues ,  respectively .  however ,  the poem is often printed with the first paragraph break omitted .  tennyson penned ulysses after the death of his close cambridge friend ,  the poet arthur henry hallam ,  with whom tennyson had a strong emotional bond .  the two friends had spent much time discussing poetry and philosophy ,  writing verse ,  and travelling in southern france ,  the pyrenees ,  and germany .  tennyson considered hallam destined for greatness ,  perhaps as a statesman .  however ,  critics note that in the homeric narrative ,  ulysses original mariners are dead .  a significant irony therefore develops from ulysses speech to his sailors come ,  my friends ,  tis not too late to seek a newer world .  since dante s ulisse has already undertaken this voyage and recounts it in the inferno ,  ulysses entire monologue can be envisioned as his recollection while situated in hell .  the contemporary reviews of ulysses were positive and found no irony in the poem .  author john sterling like tennyson a member of the cambridge apostles wrote in the quarterly review in ,  how superior is ulysses ,  there is in this work a delightful epic tone ,  and a clear impassioned wisdom quietly carving its sage words and graceful figures on pale but lasting marble .  tennyson s volume of poetry impressed scottish writer thomas carlyle .  quoting three lines of ulysses in an letter to tennyson the album was begrudgingly released by yankovic ,  who felt that the compilation was unnecessary and merely a way for his record label to make money .  several food related songs that yankovic had recorded ,  such as girls just want to have lunch and waffle king were left off the record ,  although the former was due to personal preference ,  while the latter was due to scheduling issues .  the food album received mixed reviews from music critics ,  many of whom felt that the record was an enjoyable collection of songs ,  but that it was not an essential record to purchase .  despite the lukewarm reception ,  the record was certified gold by the recording industry association of america riaa ,  making it yankovic s first and only compilation record to reach this certification .  upon release ,  the food album failed to chart however ,  it sold steadily .  on january ,  more than ten years after its release the album was certified gold by the recording industry association of america riaa .  this makes it yankovic s first and only compilation album to sell over ,  copies and be certified gold .  the patriarchal cathedral of the holy ascension of god is not the first church building to occupy the position on top of the tsarevets hill .  it was constructed directly on top of a late roman early byzantine basilica which dates to the th th century ad .  the roman basilica may have remained in use by the local congregation during the first bulgarian empire ,  though it was no longer active by the time the construction of the current church began .  daydream is the fifth studio album by american singer and songwriter mariah carey ,  released on october ,  by columbia records .  the follow up to her internationally successful album music box and holiday album merry christmas ,  daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards r b and hip hop .  throughout the project ,  carey collaborated with walter afanasieff ,  with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums .  with daydream ,  carey took more control over the musical direction as well as the album s composition .  carey said she considered daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation ,  a change that became more apparent in her sixth album butterfly .  during the album s production ,  carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband tommy mottola .  on daydream ,  carey collaborated with jermaine dupri for the first time ,  and co wrote and produced a song with kenneth babyface edmonds ,  with whom she had collaborated on music box .  it was also the first time she had worked with boyz ii men ,  an r b group consisting of four male vocalists .  together ,  they wrote the concept and lyrics for one sweet day ,  a song that carey co produced with afanasieff .  with his assistance and the addition of a few contemporary producers ,  she was able to make a subtle transition into the r b market .  daydream was nominated for six grammy awards at the th annual ceremony ,  during which carey performed live .  due to the album s critical and commercial success ,  critics believed carey would be one of the night s big winners .  however ,  to her dismay ,  she was completely shut out ,  causing the subject to become very public and controversial .  she left the annual ceremony empty handed .  at the time of its release ,  daydream became carey s best reviewed album .  critics universally praised her matured lyrics and songwriting ,  as well as her musical direction .  the album became an international success ,  debuting at number one in nine different countries ,  and in the top five in almost every major music market .  daydream became carey s second album to be certified diamond by the recording industry association of america riaa ,  denoting shipments of ten million copies in the united states .  aside from its success in the united states ,  the album made the top five of the best selling albums in japan by a non asian artist ,  with .  million copies sold .  daydream remains one of the best selling albums of all time ,  with million copies sold worldwide .  while carey s new musical direction caused tension between her and columbia ,  it began to severely strain her relationship with her husband at the time ,  tommy mottola .  mottola had always been involved in carey s career ,  because he was the head of sony music ,  the parent company of her label .  since the time of carey s debut ,  mottola had controlled nearly every aspect of her career ,  keeping her sound carefully regulated and insisting that she continue recording middle of the road pop music ,  despite her interest in hip hop .  daydream entered the billboard at number one ,  with ,  copies sold ,  staying at the top spot the following week with ,  copies sold ,  for a third consecutive week ,  it

the car ,  where my feet where .  we built the rig in front of the roller coaster and the lens kept falling off ,  when carey and boyz ii men got together to record one sweet day ,  they didn t have enough time to re unite and film a video .  for this reason ,  a filming crew was present during the song s recording ,  and filmed bits of carey and boyz recording the song .  in an interview with fred bronson ,  walter afanasieff made the following statements regarding the video for one sweet day it was crazy ,  they had film crews and video guys ,  while i m at the board trying to produce .  and these guys were running around having a ball ,  because mariah and them are laughing and screaming and they re being interviewed .  and i m tapping people on the shoulder .  we ve got to get to the microphone ,  they re gone in a couple of hours ,  so i recorded everything they did ,  praying that it was enough .  notes track listing and credits from album booklet .  fantasy contains a sample of genius of love by tom tom club .  leg before wicket lbw is one of the ways in which a batsman can be dismissed in the sport of cricket .  following an appeal by the fielding side ,  the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket ,  but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman s body except the hand holding the bat .  the umpire s decision will depend on a number of criteria ,  including where the ball pitched ,  whether the ball hit in line with the wickets ,  and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball .  after considerable debate and various experiments ,  the law was changed again in .  in an attempt to reduce pad play the new version ,  which is used to this day ,  allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat .  since the s ,  the availability of television replays and ,  later ,  ball tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches .  however ,  the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial .  in his survey of cricket laws ,  gerald brodribb states no dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw it has caused trouble from its earliest days .  owing to its complexity ,  the law is widely misunderstood among the general public and has proven controversial among spectators ,  administrators and commentators lbw decisions have sometimes caused crowd trouble .  since the law s introduction ,  the proportion of lbw dismissals has risen steadily through the years .  statistics reveal that the probability of a batsman being dismissed lbw in a test match varies depending on where the match is played and which teams are playing .  according to mcc guidelines for umpires ,  factors to consider when giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air .  he must also account for the height of the ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them .  the mcc guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching ,  but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman .  teams that toured other countries often became frustrated by lbws given against them there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams .  several studies investigating this perception have suggested that home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw .  however ,  the data is based on lbw decisions awarded ,  not on the success rate of appeals to the umpire .  fraser points out that it is impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong ,  particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations ,  or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved .  a study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws .  although the reasons were again ambiguous ,  it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location .  contemporary music critics gave the

gave tech a first down at the miami yard line .  tech continued to drive ,  picking up short yardage with multiple rushes .  the hokies suffered a near disaster when lawrence fumbled the ball ,  but tech retained possession when the ball rolled out of bounds at the one yard line .  two plays after the fumble ,  lawrence vaulted over the goal line for tech s first and only touchdown of the game .

view during the th century ,  and was not rediscovered until the early th century .  the magdalen reading can first be traced to an sale .  after passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the netherlands ,  the panel was purchased by the national gallery ,  london ,  in from a collector in paris .  it is described by art historian lorne campbell as one of the great masterpieces of th century art and among van der weyden s most important early works .  michael engler ,  the director of this episode ,  was nominated for the directors guild of america award for outstanding directing

and included in kilmer s collection trees and other poems .  the poem ,  in twelve lines of rhyming couplets of iambic tetrameter verse ,  describes what kilmer perceives as the inability of art created by humankind to replicate the beauty achieved by nature .  the location for a specific tree as the possible inspiration for the poem has been claimed by several places and institutions connected to kilmer s life among these are rutgers university ,  the university of notre dame ,  and towns across the country that kilmer visited .  however ,  kilmer s eldest son ,  kenton ,  declares that the poem does not apply to any one tree that it could apply equally to any .  trees was written in an upstairs bedroom at the family s home in mahwah ,  new jersey that looked out down a hill ,  on our well wooded lawn .  ironically ,  kenton kilmer stated that while his father was widely known for his affection for trees ,  his affection was certainly not sentimental the most distinguished feature of kilmer s property was a colossal woodpile outside his home .  kilmer s poetry was influenced by his strong religious faith and dedication to the natural beauty of the world .

season american college football bowl game at fulton county stadium in atlanta ,  georgia between the virginia tech hokies and the north carolina state wolfpack from on december ,  .  the game was the final contest of the ncaa division i a football season for both teams ,  and ended in a victory for virginia tech ,  the first bowl victory in school history .  nc state ,  needing to score ,  drove

nc state yard line .  there ,  kicker chris kinzer successfully kicked a yard field goal as time expired to give virginia tech the win .  virginia tech had not participated in a bowl game since the independence bowl against air force ,  while nc state was playing in its first postseason game since .  the two teams had played each other times prior to the peach bowl ,  with virginia tech leading the all time series ,  .  following virginia tech s kickoff ,  nc state returned the ball to the yard line ,  where the wolfpack began the game s first play .  that play was a short run to the right .  on the next play ,  nc state picked up the game s first first down with a rush up the middle by fullback mal crite .  crite picked up another first down on the next play ,  driving the wolfpack

after picking up short yardage on two rushing plays ,  tech quarterback erik chapman completed a pass to tight end steve johnson to give the hokies a first down at their yard line with just over four minutes to go in the quarter .  tech continued to drive into wolfpack territory ,  but inside the nc state yard line ,  tech committed a yard illegal block penalty that pushed the hokies back to the wolfpack yard line and had them facing a first down and yards .  though unable to gain the yards needed for another first down ,  tech did make up most of the penalty yards ,  putting the ball at the wolfpack yard line .  facing fourth down ,  tech sent in kicker chris kinzer to attempt a yard field goal ,  which was successfully completed .  the score gave tech a lead with remaining the first quarter .  kinzer delivered the post score kickoff ,  and nc state began its final drive of the first quarter at its yard line with remaining .  the wolfpack picked up a quick first down but were

and return ,  tech began another offensive possession at its yard line .  the hokies picked up two first downs and drove into nc state territory ,  but the clock continued to tick toward halftime .  in the wolfpack side of the field ,  tech running back eddie hunter broke free for a yard run ,  the longest play by virginia tech in the second quarter .  there was now just over two minutes remaining in the quarter .  tech was unable to pick up another first down after hunter s run ,  and attempted to convert the fourth down rather than trying a field goal .  when the play was stopped for a loss ,  however ,  virginia tech was denied points and nc state s offense returned with seconds remaining in the half .  the wolfpack proceeded to run out the clock and took a lead into halftime .  because nc state received the ball to begin the game ,  virginia tech received the ball to begin the second half .  tech received nc state s kickoff and returned it to the yard line ,  where the hokie offense began work .  tech began working down the field ,  running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains .  tech picked up three first downs ,  then reached nc state territory on a pass to donnelly .  once on the nc state side of the field ,  tech picked up another first down ,  but tech s quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss ,  and the hokies were forced to punt the ball away .  the ball landed at the nc state yard line where the wolfpack began a drive .  nc state went three and out after receiving the ball ,  and after tech incurred a running into the kicker penalty on the first punt attempt ,  nc state punted the ball away .  after the kick ,  tech took over on offense at its yard line .  on tech s first play after the punt ,  however ,  hunter fumbled the ball after a yard rush .  nc state recovered the ball ,  and the wolfpack offense returned to the field at the tech yard line .  on their first play after the fumble recover ,  kramer completed a yard pass to worthen for a first down .  during the next play ,  kramer fumbled the ball while attempting to run with it ,  and virginia tech s defense recovered .  this allowed the

erik kramer ran the ball ,  but fumbled at the end of the run .  the ball was recovered by virginia tech ,  and the hokie offense took the field .  the first virginia tech play of the quarter was a first down throw to david everett that drove the hokies into wolfpack territory .  tech followed the pass by driving down the field with alternating run and pass plays .  tech penetrated the nc state yard line with minutes remaining in the quarter ,  and continued to drive .  once the hokies crossed the state yard line ,  the state defense stiffened and the hokies were able to gain a first down only with difficulty .  with a first down at the state seven yard line ,  it took tech just two plays to earn a touchdown .  the hokies again attempted a two point conversion ,  but were again stopped short .  despite that setback ,  the touchdown gave tech six points and a lead ,  their first since the mark in the second quarter .  following the post score kick ,  tech began its offensive drive at its yard line with just under seven minutes to play in the game .  the hokies picked up a first down on three short rushing plays ,  then another on a single passing play .  this drove the hokies to

royal navy and french navy frigates during which a british frigate was defeated by two french vessels near isle de france now mauritius ,  but british reinforcements were able to recapture the ship before the french could secure her .  the british frigate was hms africaine ,  a new arrival to the indian ocean .  she was under the command of captain robert corbet ,  who had served there the previous year .  corbet was a notoriously unpopular officer and his death in the battle provoked a storm of controversy in britain over claims that corbet had either committed suicide at the shame of losing his ship ,  been murdered by his disaffected crew ,  or been abandoned by his men ,  who were said to have refused to load their guns while he remained in command .  whether any of these rumours were accurate has never been satisfactorily determined ,  but the issue has been discussed in several prominent naval histories and was the subject of at least one lawsuit .  the action was the first of two in this campaign in which lone british frigates were briefly overwhelmed by superior french forces as they sailed independently to join rowley s squadron .  on each occasion however ,  rowley was able to recapture the lost frigate and drive off the french attackers .  corbet s action was particularly violent ,  british casualties totalling killed and wounded ,  including every single officer and all but three of the soldiers embarked .  africaine was seriously damaged and would not be ready to return to active service for some months .  french losses were less severe ,  astre suffering one killed and two wounded ,  iphignie nine killed and wounded .  south leg the entire highway was in kent county .  west leg the entire highway was in grand rapids township ,  kent

first spacecraft to visit jupiter was pioneer in ,  followed a year later by pioneer .  aside from taking the first close up pictures of the planet ,  the probes discovered its magnetosphere and its largely fluid interior .  the voyager and voyager probes visited the planet in ,  and studied its moons and the ring system ,  discovering the volcanic activity of io and the presence of water ice on the surface of europa .  ulysses further studied jupiter s magnetosphere in and then again in .  the cassini probe approached the planet in and took very detailed images of its atmosphere .  the new horizons spacecraft passed by jupiter in and made improved measurements of its and its satellites parameters .  the galileo spacecraft was the first to have entered orbit around jupiter ,  arriving in and studying the planet until .  during this period galileo gathered a large amount of information about the jovian system ,  making close approaches to all of the four large galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them ,  as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces .  it also discovered a magnetic field around ganymede .  as it approached jupiter ,  it also witnessed the impact of comet shoemaker levy .  in december ,  it sent an atmospheric probe into the jovian atmosphere ,  so far the only craft to do so .  in july ,  the juno spacecraft ,  launched in ,  completed its orbital insertion maneuver successfully ,  and is now in orbit around jupiter and preparing for its science programme .  a major problem in sending space probes to jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land ,  as there is a smooth transition between the planet s atmosphere and its fluid interior .  any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within jupiter .  the first spacecraft to explore jupiter was pioneer ,  which flew past the planet in december ,  followed by pioneer twelve months later .  pioneer obtained the first ever close up images of jupiter and its galilean moons the spacecraft studied the planet s atmosphere ,  detected its magnetic field ,  observed its radiation belts and determined that jupiter is mainly fluid .  pioneer made its closest approach ,  within some ,  km of jupiter s cloud tops ,  on december ,  .  it obtained dramatic images of the great red spot ,  made the first observation of jupiter s immense polar regions ,  and determined the mass of jupiter s moon callisto .  the information gathered by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet .  in ,  the cassini probe ,  en route to saturn ,  flew by jupiter and provided some of the highest resolution images ever taken of the planet .  it made its closest approach on december ,  and made many scientific measurements .  about ,  images of jupiter were taken during the months long flyby .  it produced the most detailed global color portrait of jupiter yet ,  in which the smallest visible features are approximately km mi across .  major scientific results of the galileo mission include the first observation of ammonia clouds in another planet s atmosphere the atmosphere creates ammonia ice particles from material coming up from lower depths confirmation of extensive volcanic activity on io which is times greater than that found on earth the heat and frequency of eruptions are reminiscent of early earth observation of complex plasma interactions in io s atmosphere which create immense electrical currents that couple to jupiter s atmosphere providing evidence for supporting the theory that liquid oceans exist under europa s icy surface first detection of a substantial magnetic field around a satellite ganymede identification of the global structure and dynamics of a giant planet s magnetosphere .  nasa launched juno on august ,  to study jupiter in detail from a polar orbit when it arrives in .  the spacecraft will be placed in a polar orbit to study the planet s composition ,  gravity field ,  magnetic field ,  and polar magnetosphere .  juno will also search for clues about how jupiter formed ,  including whether the planet has a rocky core ,  the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere ,  and how the mass is distributed within the planet .  juno will also study jupiter s deep winds ,  which can reach speeds of km h .  juno started orbiting jupiter on the night of th july .  while scientists require further evidence to determine the extent of a rocky core on jupiter ,  its galilean moons provide the potential opportunity for future human exploration .  at this time semaphore ,  with its jetty built in ,  was the state s main entry point for passengers and mail .  it had a signal station built and a time ball tower built .  semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the s .  when the decision was made to build the fort ,  in ,  the state s population had reached approximately ,  .  settlement extended beyond port augusta ,  though adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network .  at this point adelaide had a population of over ,  .  port adelaide was the main port for south australia ,  with over ships visiting each year ,  and a local population of over ,  .  construction began in and though completed by the fort was operational in .  changes were made to the design during construction .  some forced by armament changes and others made to ensure additional security ,  including a rear defence wall and connecting road from military road .  by january two guns were in place and the fort opened later the same year with an extensive opening ceremony on october .  in addition to parades ,  a small target was moored ,  yards ,  m offshore and fired on by all guns .  a total of sixteen shots were fired during which one of the ten inch guns proved faulty .  only one ranging shot was fired and the shots were estimated to land from on target to yards short .  the fort s final cost was approximately ,  a .  million in consisting of ,  for physical structures and the remainder for armament and fittings .  at the time of its construction it was at the forefront of such fortification design ,  and was considered state of the art .  there is little in the way of surviving personnel records from the fort s active time .  they may have either been destroyed or transferred to melbourne after federation .  the fort s record book shows it manned by a section of either the royal australian artillery or b company of the militia garrison artillery .  for the time covered by the book ,  strength varied from to men of all ranks .  two figures who served at the fort are remembered for their impact outside its operation battery sergeant major charles moritz ,  who initially joined the volunteer artillery and was the permanent artillery s first recruit .  joseph maria gordon ,  the fort s first commander and later military commandant for south australia .  gordon retired in as chief of the general staff ,  australian military forces .  the entrance road was constructed from military road to the fort s rear gates .  its path is largely followed by the modern queen elizabeth ii walk ,  though the former road was slightly to the south .  this walk links the conservation park s visitor centre to the fort gates some of the old road can still be seen close to the gates .  what was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan and camping park and a car park .  it was levelled and filled in the s for this use .  what remains of this ground ,  north of the caravan park ,  was returned to its s profile in funded by a federal government grant .  in the th century ,  the muster ground was used for training of the volunteer military force including artillery ,  who camped on the site .  as designed the fort s rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade .  in a masonry wall was added ,  greatly strengthening defence .  most of the stockade was reconstructed in the s some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort s north .  after numerous proposals the sand hills rear and north of the fort were removed in ,  improving the fort s land defence and allowing the pounder guns to sweep the semaphore jetty .  this now levelled area was used as a bivouac and exercise area for the colony s volunteer troops .  a stable ,  office ,  shed and gunner s store were also erected north of the fort .  the gunner s shed was damaged by fire in and replaced further eastward .  these buildings did not survive into the st century .  both types of heavy guns used where the only ones of their specific series and type to come to australia .  though they were never fired in anger ,  the battery is only feet m above mean sea level which would have limited the accuracy of the mark iii depression rangefinders used .  prior to two inch mm breech loading guns had been imported for use in small boats .  this use was rejected by military authorities and the guns sat unused .  in the south australian defence committee proposed that the guns be mounted at fort glanville ,  replacing the pounders whose siege carriages were then unfit for service .  this proposal would have greatly extended the useful life of the fort ,  at little cost .  the two military branches ,  army and navy ,  could not reach agreement and the proposal was abandoned by .  the gun s eventual fate is unknown ,  though a gun found in the port river later indicates they may have been dumped .  fort glanville conservation park is one of south australia s most important heritage sites .  it is the premier site in the state ,  and possibly australia ,  for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications .  the fort is listed on both the south australian heritage register and the national trust s classified list .  it is considered significant ,  in national historical military terms ,  for its association with jervois and scratchley both leading british defence experts who influenced australian defence thinking in the late th century .  the fort was very well constructed with high quality materials facts that have been noted as contributing to its preservation .  the fort is largely intact and in original condition and is ,  along with bluff battery in hobart ,  the best preserved jervois scratchley designed fort in australia .  it is the only australian colonial fort to still have all of its original armament ,  and the only to have a regular living history program .  its companion fort largs does survive but in greatly modified condition ,  converted for use as the south australia police academy .  the fort retains its original armament armament that is both rare in australia and

the executive powers of the british government .  today the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the united kingdom ,  including foreign affairs ,  defence ,  and national security .  the monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters ,  but limited power ,  because the exercise of the prerogative is in the hands of the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials .  in simple terms ,  the prerogative is used to govern the realm in the name of the crown although the monarch has the right to be consulted ,  the right to encourage ,  and the right to warn ,  her role involves no exercise of discretion .  today ,  some prerogative powers are directly exercised by ministers without the approval of parliament ,  including the powers of declaring war and of making peace ,  the issue of passports ,  and the granting of honours .  prerogative powers are exercised nominally by the monarch ,  but on the advice of the prime minister whom the monarch meets weekly and of the cabinet .  some key functions of the british government are still executed by virtue of the royal prerogative ,  but generally the usage of the prerogative has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis .  abolition of the royal prerogative is not on the immediate horizon ,  and recent movements to abolish the role of the monarchy and its royal prerogative in government have been unsuccessful .  the ministry of justice undertook a review of executive royal prerogative powers in october .  former labour mp and cabinet minister tony benn campaigned unsuccessfully for the abolition of the royal prerogative in the united kingdom in the s ,  arguing that all governmental powers in effect exercised on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and require parliamentary approval .  later governments argued that such is the breadth of topics covered by the royal prerogative that requiring parliamentary approval in each instance where the prerogative is currently used would overwhelm parliamentary time and slow the enactment of legislation .  as this study was initiated ,  the route for the proposed freeway was located between th and th streets with a western end in hudsonville and an eastern end in lowell township .  the consultants were asked to study a full freeway and a limited access boulevard design .  one final option was a no build alternative under this option ,  existing roads would be upgraded but no new roads would be built .  the city of grand rapids opposed the freeway while the suburbs and townships south and west of the city supported it .  city officials were concerned about the impact to commercial and industrial business in grand rapids .  hudsonville s city manager favored the proposal as a benefit to local vegetable producers who shipped produce to detroit or cleveland .  other supporters ,  such as the georgetown township supervisor ,  were concerned that delays in starting the project could increase costs .  state and local officials expected the freeway in january to cost between million equivalent to million in .  the road was to be started no sooner than .  a second citizens group ,  the south belt citizens committee ,  was formed in july to gain additional public information on the project and supplement the work of the other groups ,  including the south belt local advisory board .  bki was fired as consultant on the project by mdot on september ,  .  the switch to a new consultant delayed further study because of the timetable to take bids and interview the candidates .  in the interim ,  work was shifted to local and state planners until a new consultant could be retained in an effort to minimize the delays involved .  these local projects were focused on updating the information and maps from bki s study and refining the scope of the highway s corridor .  construction of the remaining phases between us and m and between i and us was started on april ,  .  area roads that crossed the path of the new freeway were closed to traffic with posted detours so that work could begin on the roadbed for the freeway .  the last major project for the freeway was to replace bridge beams in the overpasses from westbound i to eastbound m .  design flaws were found in in the size of the beams in the bridges over eastbound i and the ramp from westbound m to westbound i .  the replacement was originally supposed to close traffic along i over a weekend in ,  but kept a lane closed for a full week ,  backing up traffic on the interstate for two miles .  km completion of the work was delayed when human error caused a shortage of nuts and bolts .  a year after the freeway opened ,  traffic volumes along parallel roads like th ,  th and th streets dropped .  at the same time ,  roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic .  wilson avenue experienced a increase and sections of byron center avenue jumped in traffic levels a month after m opened .  property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased .  by as a result of development attached to the freeway .  local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area ,  driving housing starts as residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life .  in ,  the metro health village ,  a commercial development centered around the byron center avenue exit and the hospital opened .  described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant ,  the village features restaurants ,  shops ,  offices and a hotel .  metro health relocated from grand rapids to the location in wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location .  since opening ,  even though the freeway was officially named for paul henry ,  the original south beltline name is still in use .  hi ,  infidelity is the

the end ,  i came out of the theater thinking of him as a three dimensional figure ,  very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil .  to be honest ,  this is very important in a

cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product .  activision later shut down sales of the series downloadable content ,  although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought .  in ,  activision announced the first new title to the series in years ,  guitar hero live ,  released in october .  the title is considered a reboot of the series ,  with development being performed by freestylegames ,  who had developed the dj hero games previously .  ahead of activision s fourth quarter financial report in february ,  activision disbanded its guitar hero business unit and announced that it would cease development of the planned guitar hero game .  activision cited continued declines in the music genre to explain its decision .  the closure also affected the dj hero series ,  as activision stated that there were no plans to publish a music game during .  activision s vice president dan winters later clarified that the company was just putting guitar hero on hiatus and that they were just not making a new game for next year ,  that s all .  the popularity of the series increased dramatically with the release of guitar hero ii for the playstation in .  featuring improved multiplayer gameplay ,  an improved note recognizing system ,  and songs ,  it became the fifth best selling video game of .  the playstation version of the game

purchased by mtv games ,  it was part of their contractual obligation to complete the game .  the game ,  as suggested by its name ,  features tracks primarily from the s .  another new title to the series ,  band hero ,  was announced in may .  band hero features top hits aimed at family audiences ,  and include the full band play style of guitar hero .  the game was developed for the nintendo ds ,  using the guitar hero on tour guitar grip ,  a new drum skin to fit the ds lite ,  and the ds s microphone to support the full band experience .  musician taylor swift appears as a playable character in the game ,  as do the members of no doubt .  guitar hero world tour introduced drums and vocal tracks in addition to lead and bass guitar .  drum tracks are played similar to guitar tracks the player must strike the appropriate drum head or step down on the bass drum pedal on the controller when the note gems pass the indicated line .  certain note gems ,  when using a drum controller that is velocity sensitive ,  are armored ,  requiring the player to hit the indicated drum pad harder to score more points .  vocal tracks are played similar to games such as karaoke revolution where the player must match the pitch and the pacing of the lyrics to score points .  guitar hero allows players to create a band of up to four players using any combination of instruments .  the series has also been criticized for its release model in contrast to the rock band series ,  causing some players to hold contempt towards activision .  harmonix considered the rock band series as a music platform ,  and supported it with downloadable content and the ability to import songs from its games and expansions into most other games of the series .  critics argued that guitar hero should have been doing the same ,  either through releasing expansions that could be incorporated into the main games of the series ,  or by issuing the songs as downloadable content .  the release of guitar hero smash hits ,  reworking older songs from the series to full four instrument band support but otherwise adding no additional material ,  was called the definition of milking by reviewers ,  with no observable technical limitation as to why the songs could not be added as downloadable content .  ars technica recognized that licensing issues might have limited when songs from one single game could be played in others of the series such as the case for the beatles rock band ,  but that such cross compatibility should have been a high priority for rhythm games .  furthermore ,  some expansions were praised for the additional content beyond the note matching gameplay guitar hero metallica is considered to be one of the series best works to be developed by neversoft in part due to the care that the developers took with imaging the band and the available extras for the game .  activision later revealed that both guitar hero and band hero would support playing songs from both guitar hero world tour both on disc and downloadable content and guitar hero smash hits ,  with music licensing being the only limiting factor on which songs could be made forward compatible .  all games are published by activision ,  except the first guitar hero and the ps version of guitar hero ii ,  which were published by redoctane .  the female is very similar to the male but the upper

football club based in the town of dover ,  kent ,  england .  the club was formed in after the dissolution of the town s previous club ,  dover f . c ,  whose place in the southern league was taken by the new club .  in the season dover athletic won the southern league championship ,  but failed to gain promotion to the football conference as the club s ground did not meet the required standard .  three seasons later the team won the title again and this time gained promotion to the conference ,  where they spent nine seasons before being relegated at the end of the season .  the club was transferred to the isthmian league premier division in ,  but another poor season and financial problems that had been mounting led the club to a further relegation .  after three seasons were spent in the isthmian league division one south ,  the club won the championship and with it promotion back to the premier division ,  followed immediately the following season by another championship and with it promotion to conference south .  five seasons were spent in that division with the club coming close to gaining promotion several times ,  reaching the play offs three times .  in the season ,  dover reached the play off final for the second successive season and defeated ebbsfleet united to return to the conference premier after a twelve year absence .  the team usually wear white shirts and are consequently nicknamed the whites .  they have played at the crabble athletic ground since the club s formation .  the club s best performance in the fa cup was an appearance in the third round proper in the and seasons ,  while the best performance registered in the fa trophy ,  the national competition for higher level non league clubs ,  was a run to the semi finals in the season .  dover athletic f . c .  was formed in after the town s previous club ,  dover ,  folded due to its debts .  the new club took dover s place in the southern league southern division ,  with former dover player alan jones as manager and a team consisting mainly of reserve players from the old club .  initially athletic struggled ,  finishing second from bottom of the table in the season .  in november steve mcrae ,  who had succeeded jones a year earlier ,  was sacked and replaced by chris kinnear .  under kinnear the club s fortunes turned round ,  with two top five finishes followed by the southern division championship ,  and with it promotion ,  in the season .  the team started strongly in the premier division ,  finishing in sixth place at the first attempt ,  and then winning the championship in the season .  the club was denied promotion to the football conference ,  however ,  as the crabble athletic ground did not meet the standard required for that league .  after finishing fourth and second in the subsequent two seasons ,  dover won the title again in the season and this time were admitted to the conference .  although dover finished in eighth place in their first season in the conference ,  the following season saw the club struggling against relegation ,  and kinnear was dismissed due to a combination of the team s poor performances and his own personal problems .  john ryan was appointed as the club s new manager ,  but his reign was a short one and he was dismissed when the club lost seven of its first eight matches in the season .  the club then appointed former england international peter taylor as manager ,  but he was unable to steer the team away from the foot of the table ,  and dover held onto their place in the conference only because northern premier league runners up boston united failed to submit their application for promotion before the required deadline .  in the club s early days athletic struggled to attract crowds of over ,  but by the time the club reached the conference ,  crowds at crabble were averaging around ,  .  after the club s relegation to the isthmian league division one south ,  the average attendance fell to just over ,  but when the club returned to the premier division for the season ,  the average attendance at crabble was ,  the highest in the division .  the highest home attendance in the club s history was ,  for the match against crystal palace in the third round of the fa cup on january .  although athletic s improved monetary position means that the supporters trust is no longer required to financially support the club ,  it remains active as a fundraising organisation .  as of th july note flags indicate national team as defined under fifa eligibility rules .  players may hold more

with either dried fruit such as grapes ,  currants ,  raisins or prunes or with fresh fruit .  there is a wide range of popular plum cakes and puddings .  since the meaning of the word plum has changed over time ,  many items referred to as plum cakes and popular in england since at least the eighteenth century have now become known as fruitcake .  the english variety of plum cake also exists on the european mainland ,  but may vary in ingredients and consistency .  settlers in british colonies brought the dried fruit variety of cake with them ,  so that for example ,  in india it was served around the time of the christmas holiday season and in the american colonies ,  where it became associated with elections ,  one version came to be called election cake .  the english variety of plum cake also exists on the european mainland ,  although plum cake there more usually refers to baked cakes made with fresh ,  rather than dried fruit .  plum cake in the united states originated with the english settlers and was prepared in the english style in sizes ranging from small ,  such as for parties in celebration of twelfth night and christmas ,  to large ,  such as for weddings .  this original fruitcake version of plum cake in the united states has been referred to as a reigning standard american celebration cake through the time of the civil war .  the song

giacomo meyerbeer born jacob liebmann beer september may was a german opera composer of jewish birth who has been described as perhaps the most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century .  with his opera robert le diable and its successors ,  he gave the genre of grand opera decisive character .  meyerbeer s grand opera style was achieved by his merging of german orchestra style with italian vocal tradition .  these were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by eugne scribe and were enhanced by the up to date theatre technology of the paris opra .  they set a standard which helped to maintain paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century .  born to a very wealthy berlin family ,  meyerbeer began his musical career as a pianist but soon decided to devote himself to opera ,  spending several years in italy studying and composing .  his opera il crociato in egitto was the first to bring him europe wide reputation ,  but it was robert le diable which raised his status to great celebrity .  his public career ,  lasting from then until his death ,  during which he remained a dominating figure in the world of opera ,  was summarized by his contemporary hector berlioz ,  who claimed that he has not only the luck to be talented ,  but the talent to be lucky .  he was at his peak with his operas les huguenots and le prophte his last opera l africaine was performed posthumously .  his operas made him the most frequently performed composer at the world s leading opera houses in the nineteenth century .  apart from around songs ,  meyerbeer wrote little except for the stage .  the critical assaults of wagner and his supporters ,  especially after his death ,  led to a decline in the popularity of his works his operas were suppressed by the nazi regime in germany ,  and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century .  meyerbeer s works are only infrequently performed today .  thus as wagner s stock rose ,  meyerbeer s fell .  in ,  the year before the paris premiere of wagner s lohengrin ,  there were no wagner performances at the paris opra ,  and performances of meyerbeer s four grand operas .  in ,  there were wagner performances ,  and only three of meyerbeer les huguenots being the sole work performed .  meyerbeer s costly operas ,  requiring grand casts of leading singers ,  were gradually dropped from the repertoire in the early th century .  they were banned in germany from ,  and subsequently in subject countries ,  by the nazi regime because the composer was jewish ,  and this was a major factor in their further disappearance from the repertory .  most importantly the operas themselves are now beginning to be revived and recorded ,  although despite the efforts of such champions as dame joan sutherland ,  who took part in performances of ,  and recorded ,  les huguenots ,  they have yet to achieve anything like the huge popular following they attracted during their creator s lifetime .  recordings are now available of all the operas from il crociato onwards ,  for many of the earlier italian operas ,  and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for struensee .  a meyerbeer discography updated whenever an additional opera by meyerbeer is issued on cd at the wayback machine archived october ,  state route sr is a .  mile .  km long state highway located entirely within benton county ,  washington ,  united states .  the highway serves to connect the unincorporated community of paterson to the county seat prosser .  the highway has existed since at least and was designated as primary state highway e from until the renumbering of washington state highways .  washington state route sr starts at an intersection with sr in the unincorporated community of paterson .  after leaving paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two lane highway .  a few minor roads are intersected before the roadway turns to the west after about mi km ,  before turning back to the north .  after the highway resumes its northerly course it climbs into the horse heaven hills ,  gaining a passing lane through the uphill segments ,  before finally terminating at sr in south prosser .  every year the washington state department of transportation wsdot conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume .  this is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic aadt ,  which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year .  in ,  wsdot calculated that as few as ,  cars traveled through the central part of the highway ,  and as many as ,  cars at the interchange with sr .  the roadway on its current alignment has existed since at least ,  however there are records of a road between paterson and prosser since .  the highway was designated secondary state highway e ssh e in ,  but the route number was changed to sr during the state highway renumbering .  high winds have forced the closure of sr in ,  and due to large amounts of dust being blown around ,  causing visibility to drop to almost zero through the horse heaven hills .  the entire highway is within unincorporated benton county .  the roller coaster originally featured two vehicles ,  each with three rows of four seats and one row of three seats for a total of riders per vehicle .  both vehicles were built to only run forward .  after the ride was refurbished in ,  new streamlined vehicles with the superman logo were introduced .  the new vehicles were designed with low profile sides to enhance the open air feeling .  although they are wider ,  the row of the three seats in the older vehicle was reduced to two ,  resulting in a lower total of riders per vehicle .  both of the new trains were configured to run backward ,  though they were designed to run forward as well .  it was reported that the park would eventually run one side forward to give riders a choice ,  but both trains have remained facing backward .  general fraser ,  alerted to the american withdrawal early on july ,  immediately set out in pursuit ,  leaving a message for general john burgoyne to send reinforcements as quickly as possible .  that night fraser camped a few miles short of hubbardton ,  and the german general friedrich adolf riedesel ,  leading reinforcements ,  camped a few miles further back .  rising early in the morning ,  fraser reached hubbardton ,  where he surprised some elements of the american rear ,  while other elements managed to form defensive lines .  in spirited battle ,  the americans were driven back ,  but had almost succeeded in turning fraser s left flank when riedesel and his german reinforcements arrived ,  eventually scattering the american forces .  the battle took a large enough toll on the british forces that they did not further pursue the main american army .  the many american prisoners were sent to ticonderoga while most of the british troops made their way to skenesboro to rejoin burgoyne s army .  most of the scattered american remnants made their way to rejoin st .  clair s army on its way toward the hudson river .  american general st .  clair paused at hubbardton to give the main army s tired and hungry troops time to rest while he hoped the rear guard would arrive .  when it did not arrive in time ,  he left colonel seth warner and the green mountain boys behind ,  along with the nd new hampshire regiment under colonel nathan hale ,  at hubbardton to wait for the rear while the main army marched on to castleton .  when francis and hale s men arrived ,  warner decided ,  against st .  clair s orders ,  that they would spend the night there ,  rather than marching on to castleton .  warner ,  who had experience in rear guard actions while serving in the invasion of quebec ,  arranged the camps in a defensive position on monument hill ,  and set patrols to guard the road to ticonderoga .  livingston and dunn ,  the two men sent toward the battle by st .  clair ,  were met by retreating americans on the castleton road after the battle was over .  they returned to castleton with the bad news ,  and the army marched off ,  eventually reaching the american camp at fort edward on july .  according to the augustan history ,  odaenathus was declared king of palmyra as soon as the news of the roman defeat at edessa reached the city .  it is not known if odaenathus contacted fulvius macrianus and there is no evidence that he took orders from him .  the elimination of the usurpers left odaenathus as the most powerful leader in the roman east he was granted many titles by the emperor but those honors are debated among scholars according to david potter ,  vaballathus inherited his father s exact titles .  hartmann points that there have been cases where a greek word was translated directly to palmyrene and a palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing .  the dedication to odaenathus would be the using of a palmyrene equivalent ,  while the inscription of vaballathus would be the direct translation .  despite all the arguments ,  it cannot be certain without doubt that odaenathus was a corrector .  in general ,  odaenathus actions were connected to his and palmyra s interests only his support of gallienus and his roman titles did not hide the palmyrene base of his power and the local origin of his armies ,  as with his decision not to wait for the emperor to help in .  odaenathus status seems to have been ,  as watson put it ,  something between powerful subject ,  independent vassal king and rival emperor .  odaenathus was assassinated along with hairan i in late the date is debated and some scholars propose or ,  but vaballathus dated his first year of reign between august and august ,  making late the most probable date .  the assassination took place either in anatolia ,  or in syria while the king was returning to palmyra there is no consensus on the manner ,  perpetrator or the motive behind the act .  the augustan history claims that a cousin of the king named maeonius killed him ,  while the anonymus post dionem names the assassin as another odaenathus .  the number of children odaenathus had with his first wife is unknown and only one is attested the children of odaenathus and zenobia are vaballathus he is attested on several coins ,  inscriptions ,  and in the ancient literature .  banksia b .  sect .  banksia series ,  species ,  subspecies ,  varieties b .  sect .  oncostylis b .  ser .  abietinae b .  sphaerocarpa

universal city ,  ca personnel it is a grade ii listed building ,  a national designation given to buildings of special interest ,  which warrant every effort being made to preserve them ,  in particular because it is a late medieval church of exceptionally simple character ,  and is virtually unaltered despite its poor condition .  one writer has said that st mary s has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in anglesey .  st mary s is a small church ,  measuring feet by feet inches about .  by .  m .  it dates from the late medieval period ,  and was constructed using rubble masonry and large stones .  it had a slate roof ,  although most of the roof has now gone ,  and there is a bellcote at the west end ,  which may be original rather than a later addition .  there is no physical division between the nave and the chancel ,  although one account in the th century said that there had originally been a screen separating them ,  and some traces of it still remained at that time .  entrance to the church was through a doorway with a square head ,  in the north wall at the west end this dates from the th century .  an inscribed stone near the doorway has the date and some initials ,  and it has been suggested that this marked the date of some renovation work .  there are two windows on the south wall ,  one fully blocked and one partially blocked .

the novel follows peter ,  who is in greenland with his father and mother for research on global warming ,  and thea ,  who lives in gracehope ,  an underground colony located below greenland .  first light explains how global warming is melting gracehope and peter and thea s attempt to persuade the people to leave .  the novel addresses the effects of global warming as a theme .  stead drew inspiration from many sources in order to create the novel .  as a child growing up in a big city ,  she was interested in the small towns which made her think that in smaller places ,  everybody ,  even the kids ,  had special identities ,  where as in a city people are pretty anonymous .  an idea began to form for a hidden society that also served as a small town .  after the revisions were completed ,  much of the plot stayed the same ,  but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book .  stead combined two characters into one ,  having a stronger outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters .  in the end ,  stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive .  the cathedral was constructed over a period of over two centuries ,  between and .  its design is a mixture of three architectural styles that predominated during the colonial period ,  renaissance ,  baroque and neo classic .  all the high reliefs of the portals of the cathedral were inspired by the work of flemish painter peter paul rubens .  this altar was damaged by fire in january but has been completely restored .  this altar has been under restoration since .  the herrera door opens into the sacristy ,  the oldest part of the cathedral .  it is a mixture of renaissance and gothic styles .  in ,  the wooden floor and platform around the perimeter of the sacristy were replaced with stone .  the cathedral s sixteen chapels were each assigned to a religious guild ,  and each is dedicated to a saint .  each of the two side naves contain seven chapels .  the other two were created later on the eastern and western sides of the cathedral .  these last two are not open to the public .  the fourteen chapels in the east and west naves are listed below .  the first seven are in the east nave ,  listed from north to south ,  and the last seven are in the west nave .  the chapel of saint isidore spanish capilla de san isidro was originally built as an annex between and ,  and was once used as the baptistery .  its vault contains plaster casts representing faith ,  hope ,  charity ,  and justice ,  considered to be basic values in the catholic religion .  after the tabernacle was built ,  it was converted into a chapel and its door was reworked in a churrigueresque style .  the cathedral contains other crypts and niches where other religious figures are buried ,  including in the chapels .  the sinking ground and seismic activity of the area have had an effect on the cathedral s construction and current appearance .  forty two years were required simply to lay its foundation when it was first built ,  because even then the spaniards recognized the danger of constructing such a huge monument in soft soil .  however ,  for political reasons ,  much ,  but not all ,  of the cathedral was built over the remains of pre hispanic structures ,  leading to uneven foundation from the beginning .  major restoration and foundation work began in the s to stabilize the building .  engineers excavated under the cathedral between and .  they dug shafts under the cathedral and placed shafts of concrete into the soft ground to give the edifice a more solid base to rest on .  these efforts have not stopped the sinking of the complex ,  but they have corrected the tilting towers and ensured that the cathedral will sink uniformly .  uss illinois bb was a pre dreadnought battleship built for the united states navy .  she was the lead ship of the illinois class ,  and was the second ship of the u .

raiding force to sink two obsolete cruisers in the canal mouth at ostend and three at zeebrugge ,  thus preventing raiding ships leaving bruges .  the ostend canal was the smaller and narrower of the two channels giving access to bruges and so was considered a secondary target behind the zeebrugge raid .  consequently ,  fewer resources were provided to the force assaulting ostend .  while the attack at zeebrugge garnered some limited success ,  the assault on ostend was a complete failure .  the german marines who defended the port had taken careful preparations and drove the british assault ships astray ,  forcing the abortion of the operation at the final stage .  to block bruges ,  keyes and lynes decided to conduct two raids on the ports through which bruges had access to the sea .  zeebrugge was to be attacked by a large force consisting of three blockships and numerous supporting warships .  ostend was faced by a similar but smaller force under immediate command of lynes .  the plan was for two obsolete cruisers hms sirius and brilliant to be expended in blocking the canal which emptied at ostend .  these ships would be stripped to essential fittings and their lower holds and ballast filled with rubble and concrete .  this would make them ideal barriers to access if sunk in the correct channel at the correct angle .  lord clive class monitors with in mm guns

witchcraft religion has been traced to britain in the early s ,  when it was used by various groups and publicised through use in adverts ,  magazines ,  and other literary sources .  it was later adopted by figures like alex sanders and gavin and yvonne frost ,  who took it to the united states .  there ,  practitioners of british traditional wicca adopted it exclusively for themselves as a means to differentiate their practices from those of other pagan witches .  this exclusive meaning was countered by its popularisation as a generic term by prolific authors such as raymond buckland ,  scott cunningham and silver ravenwolf .  as it entered popular culture ,  it gained an increasingly eclectic character in its usage .  during the s ,  some attempted to distance themselves from it by utilising the term traditional witchcraft .  since ,  dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings ,  and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries .  as a musician ,  dylan has

folk music .  in ,  he said the thing about rock nroll is that for me anyway it wasn t enough .  there were great catch phrases and driving pulse rhythms .  but the songs weren t serious or didn t reflect life in a realistic way .  i knew that when i got into folk music ,  it was more of a serious type of thing .  the songs are filled with more despair ,  more sadness ,  more triumph ,  more faith in the supernatural ,  much deeper feelings .  by the time of dylan s second album ,  the freewheelin bob dylan ,  in may ,  he had begun to make his name as a singer and a songwriter .  many songs on this album were labeled protest songs ,  inspired partly by guthrie and influenced by pete seeger s passion for topical songs .  oxford town ,  for example ,  was an account of james meredith s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the university of mississippi .  mixed up confusion ,  recorded during the freewheelin sessions with a backing band ,  was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn .  in contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album ,  the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound .  cameron crowe described it as a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards elvis presley and sun records .  in support of the album ,  dylan was booked for two u . s .  concerts with al kooper and harvey brooks from his studio crew and robbie robertson and levon helm ,  former members of ronnie hawkins s backing band the hawks .  on august at forest hills tennis stadium ,  the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by dylan s electric sound .  the band s reception on september at the hollywood bowl was more favorable .  years ago they .  said i was a prophet .  i used to say ,  no i m not a prophet they say yes you are ,  you re a prophet .  i said ,  no it s not me .  they used to say you sure are a prophet .  they used to convince me i was a prophet .  now i come out and say jesus christ is the answer .  they say ,  bob dylan s no prophet .  they just can t handle it .  the next few years saw dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering folk and blues numbers good as i been to you and world gone wrong ,  featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work .  many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song lone pilgrim ,  written by a th century teacher .  in november dylan recorded two live shows for mtv unplugged .  he said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by sony executives who insisted on hits .  the album

statement on his website as far as censorship goes ,  the chinese government had asked for the names of the songs that i would be playing .  there s no logical answer to that ,  so we sent them the set lists from the previous months .  if there were any songs ,  verses or lines censored ,  nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play .  since ,  dylan has published six books of paintings and drawings .  in a interview with bill flanagan promoting dylan s christmas lp ,  christmas in the heart ,  flanagan commented on the heroic performance dylan gave of o little town of bethlehem and that he delivered the song like a true believer .  dylan replied well ,  i am a true believer .  dylan s lyrics began to receive detailed scrutiny from academics and poets .  literary critic christopher ricks published a page analysis of dylan s work ,  placing him in the context of eliot ,  keats and tennyson ,  claiming that dylan was a poet worthy of the same close analysis .  former british poet laureate sir andrew motion argued that his lyrics should be studied in schools .  since ,  academics have lobbied the swedish academy to award dylan the nobel prize in literature .  other common names mogadishu is home to a number of scholastic and media institutions .  as part of the municipality s urban renewal program ,  schools across the capital are

burial records are incomplete .  quiney was a vintner and dealt in tobacco .  he held the lease to a house known as atwood s for the purpose of running a tavern ,  and later traded houses with his brother in law ,  william chandler ,  for the larger house known as the cage where he set up his vintner s shop in the upper half .  he is recorded as selling wine to the corporation of stratford upon avon as late as .  shakespeare quiney died at six months of age .  richard and thomas quiney were buried within a month of each other they were and years old ,  respectively .  the deaths of all of judith s children brought on new legal consequences .  the entail on her father s inheritance led susanna ,  along with her daughter and son in law ,  to make a settlement ,  by use of a rather elaborate legal device ,  for the inheritance of her own branch of the family .  legal wrangling continued for another thirteen years ,  until .  of thomas quiney s fate the records show little .  it is speculated that he may have died in or when the parish burial records are incomplete .  he certainly had a nephew in london ,  who by this time held the lease to the cage .  a transit of venus across the sun takes place when the planet venus passes directly between the sun and a superior planet ,  becoming visible against and hence obscuring a small portion of the solar disk .  during a transit ,  venus can be seen from earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the sun .  the duration of such transits is usually measured in hours the transit of lasted hours and minutes .  a transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the moon .  while the diameter of venus is more than times that of the moon ,  venus appears smaller ,  and travels more slowly across the face of the sun ,  because it is much farther away from earth .  venus transits are historically of great scientific importance as they were used to gain the first realistic estimates of the size of the solar system .  observations of the transit ,  combined with the principle of parallax ,  provided an estimate of the distance between the sun and the earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time .  the transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities ,  particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets .  venus ,  with an orbit inclined by .  relative to the earth s ,  usually appears to pass under or over the sun at inferior conjunction .  a transit occurs when venus reaches conjunction with the sun at or near one of its nodes the longitude where venus passes through the earth s orbital plane the ecliptic and appears to pass directly across the sun .  although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only ,  venus can be as far as .  from the sun when viewed from the earth at inferior conjunction .  since the angular diameter of the sun is about half a degree ,  venus may appear to pass above or below the sun by more than solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction .  in ,  johannes kepler became the first person to predict a transit of venus ,  by predicting the event .  his methods were not sufficiently accurate to predict that the transit would not be visible in most of europe ,  and as a consequence ,  nobody was able to use his prediction to observe the phenomenon .  in ,  using the combined and transit data ,  the french astronomer jrme lalande calculated the astronomical unit to have a value of million kilometers million km .  the precision was less than had been hoped for because of the black drop effect ,  but still a considerable improvement on horrocks calculations .  the transit provided scientists numerous research opportunities as well ,  in particular in regard to the study of exoplanets .  research of the venus transit includes measuring dips in a star s brightness caused by a known planet transiting the sun will help astronomers find exoplanets .  unlike the venus transit ,  the transit occurred during an active phase of the year activity cycle of the sun ,  and it is likely to give astronomers practice in picking up a planet s signal around a spotty variable star .  observation made of the atmosphere of venus simultaneously from earth based telescopes and from the venus express gives scientists a better opportunity to understand the intermediate level of venus atmosphere than is possible from either viewpoint alone .  this will provide new information about the climate of the planet .  the hubble space telescope ,  which cannot be pointed directly at the sun ,  used the moon as a mirror to study the light that had passed through the atmosphere of venus in order to determine its composition .  this will help to show whether a similar technique could be used to study exoplanets .  tessa nol is a fictional character in the television series highlander the series ,  portrayed by alexandra vandernoot .  a mortal artist and sculptor ,  tessa is the french lover of the protagonist immortal ,  duncan macleod ,  played by adrian paul .  tessa is introduced in the pilot episode the gathering ,  first shown in ,  and appears in all subsequent episodes until the darkness ,  the fourth episode of season two ,  in which she is killed .  vandernoot returned to the program for a number of guest appearances in the season two finale ,  counterfeit ,  broadcast in ,  and the two part series conclusion to be not to be .  tessa is macleod s mortal companion and bears the consequences of his immortality .  these include her aging while he does not ,  the impossibility of having children together and the dangers of macleod s involvement in the game ,  an ongoing battle in which all immortals must behead each other until a single victor remains .  fully aware of this situation ,  tessa stays with macleod ,  demonstrating her courage ,  understanding ,  generosity and compassion .  tessa nol is a central character ,  who appeared in every episode of the first season of highlander the series ,  and in the first four episodes of the second .  after the character s death ,  she later returned for cameo appearances in the episodes counterfeit part two in the second season ,  and to be and not to be ,  the sixth season s final two episodes .  to be and not to be ,  the series finale ,  respectively depict macleod dreaming of a world in which he was never born .  vandernoot reprises her role as tessa ,  this time never having met macleod .  tessa leads an unsatisfactory life in which she has a husband and children ,  but is forced to sacrifice her art and sculpture .  in this storyline she has an affair with macleod but feels she has betrayed her husband .  tessa ,  and kirsch s character richie ,  were designed as macleod s mortal companions and contacts .  tessa and macleod are lovers and share deep feelings for each other .  adrian paul commented that macleod spent twelve years with tessa without wanting another relationship and that .  she was a very important part of his life .  vandernoot thought that .  the relationship between tessa and macleod was very deep because very soon ,  he told her about himself .  because he trusted her ,  and i think trust is a very good definition of their relationship .  she trusted him entirely and he trusted her .  tessa is thus macleod s only mortal lover who knows of his immortality .  vandernoot recalled ,  i think i was quite close to tessa ,  she was very well written ,  very easy to play and i wish i was like that .  i m not sure i d like that but .  it s very nice ,  you know ,  to play a character with nice feelings and nice emotions .  vandernoot had to adapt to the north american way of filming series and learn to work fast .  she said that filming the series was .  exhausting but formative ,  and that filming in english was challenging .  vandernoot ,  who is a native french speaker ,  had a dialect coach .  during the filming of the episode ,  however ,  no dialog was recorded .  the final version of the episode shown in north america did not show richie revive .  the european version showed richie reviving ,  but no dialog was present .  this scene was later re recorded in paris in during the filming of the season finale counterfeit part two ,  this time including the dialog .  however ,  this footage was not seen in the final version the footage was eventually used in the season four episode leader of the pack .  tessa remained extremely popular with the audience after her death ,  prompting the producers to develop the season two finale episode counterfeit to bring her back .  according to kirsch ,  vandernoot did not realize her ,  or her character s ,  popularity before attending conventions .  paul said that vandernoot was surprised that her character had so much influence on the show and that her return was .  fun for her to do ,  especially to play a different character which was similar to tessa but also had an evil intent to her .  the counterfeit story features the character lisa undergoing plastic surgery to become tessa s double .  lisa was played by meilani paul before the surgery and by vandernoot after it .  the producers wondered whether the story needed to explain the change in lisa s voice ,  as she would be played by a different actor .  they considered suggesting that

brigade to two and then grew as rapidly as the developing infrastructure could support them .  the construction of the railway and a water pipeline soon enabled an infantry division to join the light horse and mounted rifle brigades at romani .  during the heat of summer ,  regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried out from their base at romani ,  while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts .  on july ,  the advance of a large german ,  austrian and ottoman force across the northern sinai was reported .  from july until the battle began ,  the australian st and nd light horse brigades took turns pushing out to clash with the advancing hostile column .  by february ,  however ,  there was no apparent sign of any unusual military activity in the sinai itself ,  when the british began construction on the first mile km stretch of foot inch .  m standard gauge railway and water pipeline from kantara to romani and katia .  reconnaissance aircraft of the royal flying corps and seaplanes of the royal naval air service found only small ,  scattered ottoman forces in the sinai region and no sign of any major concentration of troops in southern palestine .  german general friedrich freiherr kress von kressenstein s raiding force retaliated to this growing british presence ,  by attacking the widely dispersed th mounted brigade on april ,  easter sunday and also st george s day ,  when yeomanry were surprised and overwhelmed at katia and oghratina east of romani .  the mounted yeomanry brigade had been sent to guard the water pipeline and railway as they were being extended beyond the protection of the suez canal defences into the desert towards romani .  on april ,  the day after the katia and oghratina ,  chauvel ,  commander of the anzac mounted division ,  was placed in command of all the advanced troops the nd light horse brigade and the new zealand mounted rifles brigades at romani and an infantry division the nd lowland at dueidar .  the infantry moved forward to romani between may and june .  at the beginning of july ,  it was estimated there were at least ,  ottoman troops in the gaza beersheba area of southern palestine ,  and that just before the battle began at romani ,  there were ,  troops at oghratina ,  not far from katia ,  another ,  at the forward base of bir el abd ,  east of oghratina ,  to ,  at bir bayud to the south east ,  and another ,  at bir el mazar ,  some miles km to the east ,  not far from el arish .  it is also possible that the st regiment of the th division advanced to bir el abd and took part in the defence of that place .  the deployments on august on and near the battlefield were as follows the force at romani ,  responsible for its defence when the battle began ,  consisted of infantry from the british nd lowland division ,  commanded by major general w .  e .  b .  smith ,  and the anzac mounted division commanded by chauvel less the rd light horse brigade .  the st and nd light horse brigades ,  less the th light horse regiment ,  but with the new zealand mounted rifles brigade s wellington mounted rifle regiment attached were commanded by lieutenant colonels j .  b .  h meredith and j .  r .  royston respectively .  the threat of an ottoman attack towards the suez canal had been considered by lawrence in consultation with his divisional commanders ,  and a second defensive area was developed to address their concerns .  their plans took into account the possibility of an ottoman army at katia moving to attack romani or following the old caravan route to assault hill and dueidar on their way to the suez canal .  any attempt to bypass romani on the right flank would be open to attack from the garrison ,  which could send out infantry and mounted troops on the hard ground in the plain to the south west .  the new zealand mounted rifle brigade was stationed at hill at the end of june and the th light horse regiment at dueidar to prevent such an ottoman force from reaching the suez canal .  having been held south of romani ,  the german and ottoman force attempted a further outflanking manoeuvre to the west ,  concentrating ,  troops around mount royston another sand dune ,  south west of romani .  at ,  the ottoman st infantry regiment pushed forward then the nd and the th infantry regiments swung around the left and into the british rear .  this outflanking movement was steadily progressing along the slopes of mount royston and turning the right of the nd light horse brigade ,  whose third regiment ,  the wellington mounted rifles ,  was now also committed to the front line .  the german ,  austrian and ottoman attack on mount royston was checked to the north by the rd and th light horse regiments st and nd light horse brigades ,  and under constant bombardment from the horse artillery and the infantry s heavy artillery of the nd lowland division .  at ,  the front held by the two light horse brigades faced south from a point yards m northwest of no .  redoubt north of wellington ridge to the sand hills north of mount royston .  as the line had fallen back ,  the nd and rd light horse regiments st light horse brigade had come in between the th and th light horse regiments nd light horse brigade from right to left ,  the line was now held by the th ,  rd ,  nd and th light horse and the wellington mounted rifles regiments ,  while mile .  km north north west of mount royston ,  d squadron of the royal gloucestershire hussars a regiment in the th mounted brigade held its ground .  when the new zealand mounted rifles brigade s headquarters and the canterbury mounted rifle regiments were within mile .  km of dueidar on the old caravan road ,  they were ordered to move directly to canterbury hill ,  the last defensible position in front of the railway ,  east of pelusium station ,  as the strong german and ottoman attack was threatening to take the railway and romani .  the auckland mounted rifles regiment arrived with its brigade between and to find the composite yeomanry regiment th mounted yeomanry brigade in contact with the german and ottoman forces on the south west side of mount royston .  however ,  lawrence s orders for a general advance on august beginning at included an advance by the anzac mounted division .  his orders read anzac mounted division to press forward with its right on the hod el enna and its left in close touch with the infantry from the th scottish rifles brigade ,  nd lowland division ,  advancing on the line katib gannit to mount meredith .  rd light horse brigade to move towards bir el nuss and attack hod el enna from the south keeping in close touch with the anzac mounted division .  th mounted brigade ,  under orders of nd infantry division to assist the rd light horse brigade s link with the anzac mounted division s right .  nd division to move on the line canterbury hill mount royston hod el enna and drive back any opposition to the advance of the mounted troops in close support of anzac mounted division s right flank .  nd lowland division to move in close support of anzac mounted division s left flank towards mount meredith and to prepare for a general advance towards abu hamra which was not to be undertaken until further orders from lawrence at no .  section headquarters .  meanwhile ,  the german ,  austrian and ottoman force was now spread from hill almost to bir en nuss ,  but with their left flank unprotected .  they could not have been in good shape after fighting all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight ,  far from water and harassed by british infantry .  their situation was now precarious ,  as their main attacking force was well past the right of the main british infantry positions infantry in the nd lowland division was closer to the nearest enemy controlled water source at katia than most of the attacking force .  had the british infantry left their trenches promptly and attacked in a south easterly direction ,  von kressenstein s force would have had great difficulty escaping .  the two day battle for romani and the suez canal had been won by the british infantry and australian ,  british and new zealand mounted troops .  they captured approximately ,  german and ottoman combatants and killed more than ,  but the main enemy force was able to escape with all their artillery ,  except for one captured battery ,  and retreat back to oghratina after fighting a successful rearguard action at katia .  having borne the burden of the long days of patrolling ,  reconnaissance and minor engagements with the advancing austrian ,  german and ottoman columns prior to the battle ,  the st and nd light horse brigades had alone withstood the attack from midnight on august until dawn on august ,  as well as continuing to fight during the long days of battle .  by the end of august ,  they were completely exhausted their depleted ranks stumbled back to their bivouac lines at romani and etmaler where they were ordered one day s rest .  von kressenstein had prepared successive lines of defence during his advance towards romani ,  and despite losing one artillery battery and more than one third of his soldiers ,  fought a series of effective rearguard actions which slowed the pursuit by british empire mounted troops and enabled his force to retreat back to el arish .  the same three brigades one mounted rifle ,  one light horse and one yeomanry ,  with the th light horse regiment rd light horse brigade supporting the yeomanry moved to attack the german and ottoman position at oghratina ,  but the rearguard position was again found to be too strong .  lacking the support of infantry or heavy artillery ,  the mounted force was too small to capture this strong rearguard position ,  but the threat from the mounted advance was enough to force the hostile force to evacuate the position .  during the night ,  the german and ottoman forces retreated back to bir el abd ,  where they had been three weeks before ,  on july ,  when they established a base with a depot for supplies and stores .  chauvel planned ,  with lawrence s approval ,  to capture the ottoman rearguard at their forward base of bir el abd ,  miles km to the east of romani .  the position was strongly held by greatly superior numbers of germans ,  austrians and ottomans ,  supported by well placed artillery ,  but the garrison was seen burning stores and evacuating camps .  the forward troops of the german and ottoman rearguard ,  which held a front of about miles km ,  were driven back to bir el abd by the new zealanders .  at this time ,  the attackers appeared likely to succeed ,  as they had firmly established themselves across the telegraph line and the old caravan road ,  supported by the somerset and leicester batteries .  but the german ,  austrian and ottoman rearguard quickly realised how thin the attacking line was ,  and at advanced out of their trenches to counterattack .  this aggressive move was only checked by artillery fire from the somerset battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns .  the subsequent fire fight made it extremely difficult for the mounted riflemen to maintain their position ,  and on the flanks the light horse were also held up .  the german and ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards a gap between the new zealanders and the nd light horse brigade ,  but the th light horse regiment covered the gap ,  and the german and ottoman advance was halted .  chauvel ordered the rd light horse brigade ,  which had been unable to turn the german and ottoman flank ,  to move towards the new zealanders who renewed their efforts ,  but they only succeeded in exposing their flanks ,  as the australians were unable to conform to their forward movement .  by ,  all progress had stopped .  the new zealand mounted rifles brigade continued to hold on in the centre ,  while both flanks were bent back by pressure from the strong german and ottoman force .  the result was that the new zealanders ended up holding a very exposed salient line on the forward slopes of the hills overlooking the hod .  fresh german or ottoman reinforcements from el arish ,  then launched a fierce counterattack on a front of about .  miles .  km ,  on the centre .  this fell on the canterbury and auckland regiments and a squadron of warwickshire yeomanry of the th mounted brigade under chaytor s command .  the new zealanders were supported by machine guns one section ,  attached to the canterbury mounted rifles regiment ,  fired all their guns directly on the advancing soldiers ,  stopping them when they were within yards m of the new zealand position .  after this day of fierce fighting ,  which has been described as the hardest fought action of the whole sinai campaign ,  the anzac mounted division s advance was effectively stopped .  chauvel ordered the division to return to water at oghratina ,  despite lawrence s wish for them to bivouac close to bir el abd but chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force .  further ,  the anzac mounted division had lost a significant proportion of their strength over casualties ,  including eight officers and other ranks killed .  at daylight on august ,  strong patrols went forward and remained in touch with the force at bir el abd throughout the day ,  but without fresh troops ,  an attack in force could not be made .  no serious fighting took place on august ,  but von kressenstein s force at bir el abd was watched and harassed ,  and plans were made for an attack on august .  the advance of the anzac mounted division began at daylight ,  but soon afterwards ,  forward patrols reported that the garrison at bir el abd was retiring .  the mounted force followed the austrians ,  germans and ottomans as far as salmana ,  where another rearguard action delayed the mounted force ,  as the enemy withdrawal continued back to el arish .  von kressenstein succeeded in withdrawing his battered force from a potentially fatal situation both his advance to romani and the withdrawal were remarkable achievements of planning ,  leadership ,  staff work and endurance .  according to the australian official medical history ,  the total british empire casualties were other sources put the total killed at ,  with all casualties at ,  of whom were from the anzac mounted division .  ottoman army casualties have been estimated to have been ,  were buried after the battle and ,  were taken prisoner .  this battle was fought under extreme conditions in the sinai desert in midsummer heat over many days ,  causing much suffering to man and beast and demanding tenacity and endurance on the part of all who took part .  the battle of romani marked the end of the german and ottoman campaign against the suez canal the offensive had passed decisively into the hands of the british empire force led by the anzac mounted division .  after the battle ,  von kressenstein s force was pushed back across the sinai peninsula ,  to be beaten at the battle of magdhaba in december and back to the border of ottoman empire controlled palestine to be defeated at the battle of rafa in january ,  which effectively secured the egyptian sinai peninsula .  this successful ,  seven month long british empire campaign ,  begun at romani in august ,  ended at the first battle of gaza in march .  it has been suggested that an opportunity was lost on august to encircle and capture the invading austrian ,  german and ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to katia .  the infantry s difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training ,  together with lawrence s confusing orders for infantry in the nd lowland division to move south and east ,  stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day s battle .  general lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend romani .  that the strong enemy attack on the st and nd light horse brigades during the first night s battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the new zealand mounted rifles brigade became almost a frontal attack .  lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at kantara ,  which was considered to be too far from the battlefield ,  and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day ,  when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with romani .  lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise the execution of his orders on august ,  when there was a failure to coordinate the movements of the rd light horse brigade and the mobile column .  chauvel responded by pointing out that the criticisms of the battle were in danger of obscuring the significance of the victory .  but he failed to ensure the fighting qualities of these soldiers earned them a proportionate share of recognition and honours .  further ,  despite claims that chauvel alone had a clear view of the battle ,  that his coolness and skill were crucial in gaining the victory ,  his name was omitted from the long list of honours published on new year s day .  murray did offer chauvel a lesser award a distinguished service order for romani which he declined .  i am afraid my men will be very angry when they see it .  i cannot understand why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much and the whole thing is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled .  having sold million copies of his previous novels in languages ,  grisham had produced an international bestseller with

developed in britain and ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental europe and contributed to the development of romanesque and gothic styles .  it can be seen in elaborate jewellery ,  often making extensive use of semi precious stones ,  in the heavily carved high crosses found particularly in the highlands and islands ,  but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the book of kells ,  which may have been begun ,  or wholly created at the monastic centre of iona .  scotland adopted the romanesque style relatively late and retained and revived elements of its style after the gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century .  much of the best scottish artwork of the high and late middle ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork ,  and has not survived the impact of time and the reformation .  however ,  examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture ,  including evidence of elaborate church interiors .  from the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies .  native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items .  visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings .  surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude ,  but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent ,  particularly the netherlands .  architectural evidence suggests that ,  while the romanesque style peaked in much of europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century ,  it was still reaching scotland in the second half of the twelfth century and was revived in the late fifteenth century ,  perhaps as a reaction to the english perpendicular style that had come to dominate .  much of the best scottish artwork of the high and late middle ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the reformation .  however ,  examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture ,  a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and ,  for the end of the period ,  there is evidence of painting ,  particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the low countries and france .  humpty dumpty is a character in an english nursery rhyme ,  probably originally a riddle and one of the best known in the english speaking world .  he is typically portrayed as an anthropomorphic egg ,  though he is not explicitly described so .  the first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth century england and the tune from in james william elliott s national nursery rhymes and nursery songs .  its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings .  the rhyme is one of the best known and most popular in the english language .  the most common modern text is i don t know what you mean by glory ,  alice said .  but glory doesn t mean a nice knock down argument ,  alice objected .  the question is ,  said alice ,  whether you can make words mean so many different things .  the question is ,  said humpty dumpty ,  which is to be master that s all .  the face is what one goes by ,  generally ,  alice remarked in a thoughtful tone .  that s just what i complain of ,  said humpty dumpty .  your face is the same as everybody has the two eyes ,  marking their places in the air with his thumb nose in the middle ,  mouth under .  it s always the same .  now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose ,  for instance or the mouth at the top that would be some help .  a variation on the poem using near sounding french nonsense words is often used to illustrate the difficulty of speech recognition in different languages .  a common version is as follows to a listener expecting a nursery rhyme ,  it will generally be heard as the english version ,  while someone expecting french will instead tend to hear nonsense words .  in the organisation was registered as a limited company ,  and the cardiff season was extended from one week to two .  the following year the company gave its first performances in swansea .  the chorus featured performers by this time .  in the late s wno combined with the cardiff based welsh drama company ,  becoming

every team managed to win at least competition points the equivalent of a win and a draw or three draws since .  however ,  england did again defeat scotland for the calcutta cup at twickenham .  england have typically worn all white shirts ,  white shorts with navy and white socks .  the emblem on the shirts is a red rose ,  rather than the plantagenet three lions displayed on the shirts of the england football and cricket teams .  the strip is manufactured by canterbury and o is the shirt sponsor .  red was the change strip ,  although prior to the introduction of the red strip ,  navy blue was used .  purple was used as the change strip as of the autumn internationals ,  reflecting the traditional colour of the original england track suits from the s ,  s and s .  for the rugby world cup the change kit was black .  in england first used a skin tight strip .  this was intended to make it more difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling .  the home and away

s cross on the top left ,  and a changed away strip dark blue to red ,  have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on st george s cross at the expense of the traditional red rose .  the new strip was introduced in england s home game against wales on august ,  while the alternative strip was first used against france on august .  england competes annually in the six

adapted from the liner notes for fortune hms black prince was a duke of edinburgh class armoured cruiser built for the royal navy in the mid s .  she was stationed in the mediterranean when the first world war began and participated in the pursuit of the german battlecruiser sms goeben and light cruiser sms breslau .  after the german ships reached ottoman waters ,  the ship was sent to the red sea in mid august to protect troop convoys arriving from india and to search for german merchant ships .  after capturing two ships ,  black prince was transferred to the grand fleet in december and was sunk during the battle of jutland in may ,  with all hands killed .  two armoured cruisers of a new design ,  duke of edinburgh and black prince ,  the latter named for edward ,  the black prince ,  were ordered for the royal navy as part of the naval estimates .  they were the first ships to be designed for the royal navy under the supervision of the new director of naval construction ,  sir philip watts .  the new design was significantly larger than the previous monmouth and devonshire class cruisers ,  mounting a heavier main armament of six .  in mm guns in single turrets .  black prince was modified in march as a result of lessons learned at the battle of coronel ,  with the inch guns removed from their casemates and replaced by six inch guns mounted individually behind shields between the beam .  inch turrets .  the ship participated in the battle of jutland ,  where she was sunk with heavy loss of life .  the circumstances under which she sank were mysterious for some years after .  as the british had lost contact and did not see the ship destroyed ,  they were unsure as to whether a submarine or surface ship was responsible for sinking black prince .  during the battle ,  the st cruiser squadron was deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the grand fleet ,  but black prince lost contact with the rest of the squadron as it came into contact with german forces ,  at about .  soon after ,  two other members of the st cruiser squadron ,  defence and warrior were heavily engaged by german battleships and battlecruisers ,  with defence blowing up and warrior receiving heavy damage ,  which later caused her to sink .  in ,  baltimore experienced high rates of murder and unemployment ,  and had a failing city school system .  o malley declared his candidacy ,  focusing his campaign on a zero tolerance approach to crime .  he received endorsements from many of the city s african american leaders .  after a close race ,  o malley overtook both stokes and bell to win the democratic nomination ,  which all but assured him of victory in the general election .  he defeated republican candidate david f .  tufaro in the general election by an overwhelming majority .  kurt schmoke ,  the incumbent mayor of baltimore ,  was serving his third term .  he announced in december that he would not run for reelection the following year ,  the first time an incumbent baltimore mayor did not run for reelection since .  schmoke was the first african american mayor in baltimore s history .  o malley initially supported bell s candidacy .  bell urged o malley to endorse him ,  and offered him the job of city solicitor in exchange for his support .  however ,  o malley began to distance himself from bell ,  not appearing at bell s campaign announcement ,  due to disagreements on several bills debated at the city council .  bell s supporters attempted to convince o malley to run for city council president ,  but o malley announced his decision to run for mayor in june ,  becoming the first major candidate in the race who was caucasian .  he began the campaign largely unknown outside of northeast baltimore .  republican party officials quickly began to back tufaro ,  who criticized the democratic party by pointing out that democrats have led baltimore in its decline .  fifteen candidates ended up running in the democratic primary .  the front runners were considered to be o malley ,  bell ,  and stokes .  schmoke made no endorsement in the race .  o malley and bell called for zero tolerance to all crime ,  though stokes felt this policy was biased against minorities .  stokes ran on the issue of education ,  as he was a former member of the baltimore school board ,  in addition to the city council .  stokes vowed to reduce class sizes and reverse the trend of citizens of baltimore leaving the city to live in nearby suburbs .  bell led stokes in a poll conducted early in the race ,  to ,  before o malley declared his candidacy .  by late august ,  bell slipped in the polls to third place ,  with o malley and stokes tied .  bell and o malley began airing television commercials supporting their campaigns in early august ,  while stokes did not begin to air commercials until september .  o malley also advertised on the radio .  in the september republican primary ,  tufaro received over half of the votes cast .  adair finished in second place .  tufaro criticized o malley s zero tolerance policy ,  suggesting it would lead to increased police brutality towards minorities .  he instead proposed continuing mayor schmoke s community policing strategy .  opponents of the zero tolerance policy tried to tie o malley to the baltimore police shooting of an african american car theft suspect .  o malley was ineligible to run in the gubernatorial election due to term limits .  o malley publicly expressed interest in a presidential run in on multiple occasions .  at a press conference at a national governors association meeting ,  o malley stated he was laying the framework for a presidential run .  show creator david simon denied that the character of tommy carcetti was supposed to be o malley ,  though he did acknowledge that o malley was one of several inspirations for carcetti .  he further stated that while carcetti was reflective of o malley ,  carcetti was a composite drawing aspects from other local politicians that he had covered when he worked as a reporter for the baltimore sun .  an international conference that the government of pondicherry and the italian ministry of foreign affairs held in october decided to investigate the arikamedu site jointly for conservation ,  as its ancient

africa ,  which moved westward across the atlantic ocean without development .  on september ,  an area of convection ,  or thunderstorms ,  developed along the northern portion of the wave ,  but was eventually absorbed into tropical storm gabrielle north of puerto rico .  the wave continued westward through the caribbean sea into a large area of cyclonic flow at the surface ,  which extended across central america into the eastern pacific .  around september ,  the broad system developed two areas of disturbed weather one in the eastern pacific would become hurricane manuel ,  and the other developing over the northwestern caribbean .  the latter system slowly organized ,  developing a low pressure area on september .  subsequently ,  the system moved over the yucatn peninsula .  although land interaction prevented immediate development ,  conditions favored further development in the bay of campeche .  early on september ,  the low emerged into the bay ,  and at utc the national hurricane center nhc assessed that tropical depression ten developed about km mi east northeast of veracruz .  this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight indicating the presence of a closed low level circulation .  after weakening into a remnant low ,  felicia continued to approach the hawaiian islands and on august ,  the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands .  the highest total was recorded on oahu at .  in mm ,  causing isolated mudslides and flooding .  in maui ,  the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages ,  significantly increasing the total water across the island s reservoirs .  in addition ,  river flooding resulted in the closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at island beaches .  in all ,  only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of felicia .  after slightly weakening throughout the day on august ,  felicia leveled out with winds of mph km h and a mi km wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane ,  which would allow felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters .  early the next day ,  the structure of the hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly .  this marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal category hurricane .  several hours later ,  the mid level circulation began to separate from the low level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased .  by this time ,  the storm began to take a long anticipated westward turn towards hawaii .  after briefly re intensifying on august ,  felicia weakened to a category hurricane early on august .  around am hst utc ,  the central pacific hurricane center cphc took over responsibility of issuing advisories as felicia crossed longitude w .  by august ,  increasing wind shear further weakened the storm ,  with felicia being downgraded to a tropical storm early that day .  the storm rapidly weakened throughout the day as convection gradually dissipated around the center due to the shear .  by the late morning hours ,  little convective activity remained around the low pressure center of felicia .  a weak cyclone ,  the storm continued to track towards hawaii with the only deep convection associated with it being displaced to the northeast of the center .  the system slowly weakened before being downgraded to a tropical depression on august as no areas of tropical storm force winds were found by hurricane hunters .  several hours after being downgraded ,  the cphc issued its final advisory on felicia as it degenerated into a remnant low near the hawaiian islands .  the system dissipated shortly thereafter .  the liner notes for the bootleg series volumes list the song s personnel as dylan ,  guitar and vocals robertson ,  guitar hudson ,  organ manuel ,  piano danko ,  bass and helm ,  drums

children initially because of high infant mortality rates ,  only a few children survived adolescence .  colonial families existed to serve six main functions self sufficient business ,  school ,  vocational institute ,  church ,  house of correction ,  and welfare institution .  the modern family is commonly thought to have originated in the s courtship became more open ,  marriages were often based on affection ,  and parents devoted more attention to children .  at the beginning of the th century ,  married couples began to emphasize the importance of sexual attraction and compatibility in their relationships .  this led to more intimate and open relationships along with more adolescent freedom .  the transition of the family was influenced by the great depression ,  which forced many women into the workplace in order to compensate for lack of financial stability .  in ,  a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government .  this resulted in many women being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working .  the s saw a baby boom in america .  this period was also called the golden s .  this was credited to families trying to make up lost time after the war .  as a result ,  many families moved to the suburbs instead of residing in the city ,  the number of two income families began to increase ,  and grown children began to remain at home longer because of financial difficulties .  gradually ,  women began re entering the workforce .  this progression away from the traditional view of the woman as the homemaker led to the creation of the role of the stay at home dad .  stay at home dads have been seen in increasing numbers in western culture ,  especially in canada ,  the uk and the united states since the late th century .  in developed east asian nations such as japan and south korea ,  this practice is less common .  there are several reasons why some families feel that it would be more beneficial for the father to be the primary caregiver while the mother works outside of the home .  the decision to use a stay at home dad arrangement is most commonly due to economic reasons .  at the same time ,  women are progressing into higher paying jobs .  there are now financial ramifications in deciding whether the mother or father should become the stay at home parent .  in cases where the woman is the higher paid parent ,  it makes more economic sense for her to continue to work while the man takes on the caregiver role .  it also makes sense at times the mother s job offers health benefits for the family whereas the father s does not .  it has also been shown that if the pregnancy was jointly planned ,  the father is more likely to be involved .  one study by the american heart association suggested stay at home dads may face a higher risk of heart disease .  the reasons for the health risk are not specified .  the role of stay at home dad may be difficult for men who feel as though they had no option .  it is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker .  men who willingly choose to become a stay at home dad are much more satisfied with their role in the family .  no longer the money maker in the family ,  may become an issue due to not being the main support and rock for the family .  missing their children .  becoming the main source of income for the family and working long hours away from home and family .  will lose less time with their children and will devote of their day to work force and to their children .  there have been many studies done which suggest the importance of the paternal role in a child s life and benefits of the stay at home dad .  children respond differently to males and females at birth .  stay at home dads make up a very small portion of the australian population although this appears to be rapidly changing .  in ,  of fathers with children aged under years were employed with employed full time .  because of this ,  there are few role models or resources that can help australian fathers with the stay at home dad role .  the australian bureau of statistics show that approximately of two parents families with children under the age of have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full time .  stay at home dads in australia have almost doubled over the past decade from ,  to ,  and expected to increase in the future .  recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the th century .  the idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream ,  however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise .  stay at home dads are not prevalent in east asian countries ,  which generally have strict traditional gender roles .  however ,  a survey conducted in in japan suggested that nearly one third of married men would accept the role .  the japanese government passed a law in april allowing time off following the birth of a child for both male and female employees .  in ,  .  of japanese fathers took time off of work to raise children .  in south korea ,  about ,  men were stay at home dads in .  even so ,  stay at home dads face discrimination from stay at home mothers ,  and are often ostracized .  according to an article by the daily mail ,  the number of stay at home dads in had increased by percent since .  according to the same paper ,  in ,  recent figures from the office for national statistics showed more than ,  fathers chose to stay at home and be the primary caregiver for their children .  billy ashley ,  american baseball player michael stephen clark ,  american columnist john lennon ,  british musician

unincorporated villages and a hamlet are on the creek ,  and its watershed drains .  square miles km in parts of five townships .  the creek is a part of the chesapeake bay drainage basin via loyalsock creek and the west branch susquehanna and susquehanna rivers .  although the plunketts creek watershed was clear cut and home to a tannery ,  sawmills ,  and a coal mine in the nineteenth century ,  today it is heavily wooded and known for its high water quality ,  fishing ,  and other recreational opportunities .  the watershed now includes parts of the loyalsock state forest ,  pennsylvania state game lands ,  and a state game farm for raising pheasant .  tourism ,  hunting ,  and fishing have long been important in the region ,  and its year round population is increasing much faster than that of either lycoming or sullivan county .  during the american revolution ,  plunkett did not actively support the revolution and thus was suspected of being sympathetic to the british empire .  he died in ,  aged about ,  and was buried in northumberland ,  without a grave marker or monument except for the creek that bears his name .  lycoming county was formed from northumberland county in .  when plunketts creek township was formed in lycoming county in ,  the original name proposed was plunkett township but the lingering suspicions of his british sympathies led to that name being rejected .  naming the township for the creek was an acceptable compromise .  plunketts creek township was originally much larger than it is now ,  and two other townships were formed from parts of it .  when sullivan county was formed from lycoming county on march ,  plunketts creek township was divided between the counties ,  with each having a township of the same name .  this led to some confusion and in the citizens of sullivan county petitioned the state legislature to change the name of their plunketts creek township to hillsgrove township ,  for hillsgrove ,  the main village and post office in the township .  in ,  cascade township was formed from parts of hepburn and plunketts creek townships in lycoming county .  the previous record flood reached .  feet .  m on the loyalsock flood gauge at barbours on january ,  .  this major flood resulted from heavy rain ,  snow melt ,  and ice dams ,  which caused millions of dollars of damage throughout lycoming county ,  and six deaths on lycoming creek in and near williamsport .  on plunketts creek ,  the flood heavily damaged and later caused the demolition of plunketts creek bridge no ,  a mid th century stone arch bridge listed on the national register of historic places .  the flood waters were feet .  m deep in barbours and it was called the village s worst flood in history at the time .  the named tributaries together account for .  of the plunketts creek watershed .  the largest tributary is wolf run ,  with an area of .  square miles .  km ,  accounting for .  of the total .  the wolf run drainage basin includes both the noon branch .  square miles .  km and the brian branch .  square miles .  km .  the next largest tributary of plunketts creek is king run with .  square miles .  km or

tributary in coal mine hollow with .  square miles .  km or .  all other named tributaries are less than .  square mile .  km and account for less than of the drainage basin individually .  plunketts

championship runner up individual preston north end player of the year berhtwald s period as archbishop coincided with the end of wilfrid s long struggle to regain the bishopric of york ,  and the two year delay between theodore s death and berhtwald s election may have been due to efforts to select wilfrid for canterbury .  after his election ,  berhtwald went to gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the wilfrid issue ,  finally succeeding at the second council in .  berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in western europe .  xenon is a member of the zero valence elements that are called noble or inert gases .  it is inert to most common chemical reactions such as combustion ,  for example because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons .  this produces a stable ,  minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound .  unlike the lower mass noble gases ,  the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon .  elements more massive than iron have a net energy cost to produce through fusion ,  so there is no energy gain for a star when creating xenon .  instead ,  xenon is formed during supernova explosions ,  by the slow neutron capture process s process of red giant stars that have exhausted the hydrogen at their cores and entered the asymptotic giant branch ,  in classical nova explosions and from the radioactive decay of elements such as iodine ,  uranium and plutonium .  after neil bartlett s discovery in that xenon can form chemical compounds ,  a large number of xenon compounds have been discovered and described .  almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen .  three fluorides are known xef ,  xef ,  and xef .  xef is theorized to be unstable .  the fluorides are the starting point for the synthesis of almost all xenon compounds .  the solid ,  crystalline difluoride xef is formed when a mixture of fluorine and xenon gases is exposed to ultraviolet light .  ordinary daylight is sufficient .  long term heating of xef catalyst yields xef .  f ,  and anions such as xef ,  xef is formed by the reduction of xef by xenon gas .  xef is also able to form coordination complexes with transition metal ions .  over such complexes have been synthesized and characterized .  three oxides of xenon are known xenon trioxide xeo and xenon tetroxide xeo xenon does not react with oxygen directly the trioxide is formed by the hydrolysis of xef xef h o xeo hf xeo anion .  ba h h o xeo to prevent decomposition ,  the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled to form a pale yellow solid .  it explodes above .  c into xenon and oxygen gas ,  xeof ,  xeo f ,  and xeo .  xeof with xenon gas at low temperatures .  it may also be obtained by the partial hydrolysis of xef and xeo f .  xeof is formed by the partial hydrolysis of xef ,  or the reaction of xef with sodium perxenate ,  na .  the latter reaction also produces a small amount of xeo .  xeof anion .  c f f c f f c f xef c f f ,  at c .  sb f the compound xe f although xenon is rare and relatively expensive to extract from the earth s atmosphere ,  it has a number of applications .  the individual cells in a plasma display use a mixture of xenon and neon that is converted into a plasma using electrodes .  the interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons ,  which then excite the phosphor coating on the front of the display .  xenon has been used as a general anesthetic .  although it is expensive ,  anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the european market ,  because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable .  because of the xenon atom s large ,  flexible outer electron shell ,  the nmr spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions ,  and can therefore be used as a probe to measure the chemical circumstances around it .  for instance xenon dissolved in water ,  xenon dissolved in hydrophobic solvent ,  and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by nmr .  in nuclear energy applications ,  xenon is used in bubble chambers ,  probes ,  and in other areas where a high molecular weight and inert nature is desirable .  a by product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon and xenon .  the detection of these isotopes is used to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties ,  as well as to confirm nuclear test explosions by states such as north korea .  when duarte suddenly died and his mistress and their children sought to attend his funeral ,  there was an unpleasant scene at the church gates .  although juana and the children were permitted to enter and pay their respects to duarte ,  they were promptly directed out of the church .  mrs .  juan duarte did not want her husband s mistress and children at the funeral and ,  as those of the legitimate wife ,  her orders were respected .  after his release from prison ,  juan pern decided to campaign for the presidency of the nation ,  which he won in a landslide .  eva campaigned heavily for her husband during his presidential bid .  using her weekly radio show ,  she delivered powerful speeches with heavy populist rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with pern s movement .  though she had become wealthy from her radio and modeling success ,  she highlighted her own humble upbringing as a way of showing solidarity with the impoverished classes .  eva then visited rome ,  where the reception was not as warm as it had been in spain .  though pope pius xii did not give her a papal decoration ,  she was allowed the time usually allotted queens and was given a rosary .  members of the peronist opposition speculated that the true purpose of the european tour was to deposit funds in a swiss bank account .  the opposition in buenos aires ,  write fraser and navarro ,  assumed that the genuine purpose of the whole european visit was for eva and her husband to deposit money in swiss bank accounts ,  and that the rest had been devised to conceal this .  many wealthy argentines did this ,  but there are many more convenient and less conspicuous ways of depositing money in swiss accounts than meeting the swiss foreign minister and being shown around a watch factory .  fraser and navarro conclude ,  was there a swiss bank account ,  it seems unlikely .  a new women s suffrage bill was introduced ,  which the senate of argentina sanctioned on august .  it was necessary to wait more than a year before the house of representatives sanctioned it on september .  law ,  established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in argentina .  finally ,  law ,  was approved unanimously .  in a public celebration and ceremony ,  however ,  juan pern signed the law granting women the right to vote ,  and then he handed the bill to eva ,  symbolically making it hers .  in ,  evita set her sights on earning a place on the ballot as candidate for vice president .  this move angered many military leaders who despised evita and her increasing powers within the government .  according to the argentine constitution ,  the vice president automatically succeeds the president in the event of the president s death .  the possibility of evita becoming president in the event of juan pern s death was not something the military could accept .  she did ,  however ,  receive great support from the working class ,  the unions ,  and the peronist women s party .  the intensity of the support she drew from these groups is said to have surprised even juan pern himself .  fraser and navarro write that the wide support evita s proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that evita had become as important to members of the peronist party as juan pern himself was .  in a ceremony a few days after juan pern s second inauguration ,  evita was given the official title of spiritual leader of the nation .  there were different interpretations of the popular mourning of eva pern s death .  some reporters viewed the mourning as authentic ,  others saw a public succumbing to another of the passion plays of the peronist regime .  time magazine reported that the peronist government enforced the observance of a daily period of five minutes of mourning following a daily radio announcement .  in the book eva pern the myths of a woman ,  cultural anthropologist julie m .  taylor claims that evita has remained important in argentina due to the combination of three unique factors halo uprising is a four issue american comic book limited series set in the halo universe .  the series was written by brian michael bendis ,  illustrated by alex maleev ,  and published by marvel comics .  uprising tells a story set between the ending of the video game halo and the beginning of its sequel ,  halo ,  as earth is under attack by a collective of alien races known as the covenant .  the series was intended to be released and concluded before halo shipped on september ,  but the final issue did not appear until april .  the series was brought together by ruwan jayatilleke ,  marvel s vice president of development .  he attained the license to publish halo comics ,  including the single volume the halo graphic novel ,  in .  the graphic novel s critical and commercial success prompted marvel to announce a new halo limited series in with jayatilleke serving as the series editor .  bendis ,  a long time halo fan ,  was excited about adding to the franchise story .  reception to the series was lukewarm .  the series artistic style was generally praised .  however ,  the lack of master chief focused action and character development as well as the delays in publishing led to average reviews .  the series was commercially successful and appeared in the top slot of the new york times graphic books bestsellers list .  on board the forerunner ship ,  the master chief is captured and interrogated by covenant forces ,  but manages to escape using a concealed weapon .  on earth ,  ruwan and tyla escape detection by the covenant and appropriate a vehicle in an effort to escape .  ruwan reveals that the key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother james ackerson made up as children james told the covenant about the key in order to prevent the outright destruction of cleveland .  after fighting covenant forces ,  ruwan and tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city .  the master chief attempts to kill the covenant s leader ,  prophet of truth ,  but is discovered as he takes aim truth escapes as the chief is left to kill the prophet s guards and find a way off the ship .  learning that there is no way to change the forerunner ship s destination ,  the chief jumps to earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield .  halo uprising was a commercial success .  the first issue sold out within hours ,  leading marvel to reissue the installment .  the collected hardcover edition was the best selling hardcover graphic book for the week ending june ,  according to the new york times .  most of the principal photography was done in los angeles ,  california ,  where the film is set .  several scenes were filmed in utah and at the arecibo observatory in puerto rico .  the film was poorly received by critics ,  but nevertheless turned out to be a box office success ,  grossing us million million in dollars .  it spawned one theatrical sequel species ii ,  as well as two direct to video sequels species iii and species the awakening .  species was adapted into a novel by yvonne navarro and two comic book series by dark horse comics ,  one of which was written by feldman .  natasha henstridge as sil michelle williams as young sil ben kingsley as xavier fitch michael madsen as preston press lennox alfred molina as dr .  stephen arden marg helgenberger as dr .  laura baker john of brienne c .  march ,  also known as john i ,  was king of jerusalem from to and latin emperor of constantinople from to .  he was the youngest son of erard ii of brienne ,  a wealthy nobleman in champagne .  john ,  originally destined for an ecclesiastical career ,  became a knight and owned small estates in champagne around .  after the death of his brother ,  walter iii ,  he ruled the county of brienne on behalf of his minor nephew walter iv who lived in southern italy .  andrew ii decided to return home ,  leaving the crusaders camp with hugh i and bohemond iv in early .  although military action was suspended after their departure ,  the crusaders restored fortifications at caesarea and atlit .  after new troops arrived from the holy roman empire in april ,  they decided to invade egypt .  they elected john supreme commander ,  giving him the right to rule the land they would conquer .  his leadership was primarily nominal ,  since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries .  the crusaders laid siege to damietta ,  on the nile ,  in may .  although they seized a strategically important tower on a nearby island on august ,  al kamil who had succeeded al adil i in egypt controlled traffic on the nile .  in september ,  reinforcements commanded by pope honorius iii s legate cardinal pelagius who considered himself the crusade s supreme commander arrived from italy .  egyptian forces attempted a surprise attack on the crusaders camp on october ,  but john discovered their movements .  he and his retinue attacked and annihilated the egyptian advance guard ,  hindering the main force .  the crusaders built a floating fortress on the nile near damietta ,  but a storm blew it near the egyptian camp .  the egyptians seized the fortress ,  killing nearly all of its defenders .  only two soldiers survived the attack they were accused of cowardice ,  and john ordered their execution .  taking advantage of the new italian troops ,  cardinal pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions .  his debates with john angered their troops .  the soldiers broke into the egyptian camp on august without an order ,  but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated .  during the ensuing panic ,  only the cooperation of john ,  the templars ,  the hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the egyptians from destroying their camp .  stephanie died shortly after john s arrival .  contemporary sources accused john of causing her sudden death ,  claiming that he severely beat her when he heard that she tried to poison his daughter isabella .  their only son died a few weeks later ,  ending john s claim to cilicia .  soon after pope honorius learned about the deaths of stephanie and her son ,  he declared raymond roupen the lawful ruler of cilicia and threatened john with excommunication if he fought for his late wife s inheritance .  the latin emperor of constantinople ,  robert i ,  died in january .  his brother baldwin ii succeeded him ,  but a regent was needed to rule the latin empire since baldwin was ten years old .  ivan asen ii of bulgaria was willing to accept the regency ,  but the barons of the latin empire suspected that he wanted to unite the latin empire with bulgaria .  they offered the imperial crown instead to john ,  an ally of the holy see .  boise national forest is within the idaho batholith ecoregion ,  which is a level iii ecoregion in the larger level i northwestern forested mountains .  in addition to species listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act ,  the forest service maintains an independent listing of sensitive species for which it is directed to develop and implement management practices to ensure that species do not become threatened or endangered because of forest service actions .  as of february there were species in boise national forest listed as sensitive species mammals ,  amphibian ,  fish ,  birds ,  and plants .  gray wolves are top predators that were reintroduced amidst controversy to central idaho in the mid s to restore ecosystem stability .  the wolves have since expanded their range and established packs in most of boise national forest .  wolves and mountain lions are the forest s top large mammal predators and have no predators of their own except humans .  most of the forest s native mammal species are present in the forest ,  with the exception of grizzly bears ,  which have become locally extinct ,  and plans for their reintroduction to central idaho have been proposed since the s but have not progressed .  pokiri was released on april ,  to positive critical feedback ,  and collected a distributor s share of million .  the film grossed million worldwide and remained the highest grossing telugu film for three years ,  until it was surpassed by magadheera in .  the film was also one of the fourteen southern indian films to be screened at the international indian film academy awards iifa film festival in .  the film won four nandi awards and two filmfare awards .  the film s success catapulted d cruz into stardom and brought recognition to jagannadh as a writer and director .  the bahrain grand prix formally the v gulf air bahrain grand prix was a formula one motor race held on april at the bahrain international circuit ,  in sakhir ,  bahrain .  it was the third race of the formula one season .  the lap race was won by felipe massa for the ferrari team .  kimi rikknen was second in the other ferrari ,  and bmw sauber driver robert kubica was third .  the race began with kubica in pole position alongside massa lewis hamilton ,  the eventual drivers champion ,  started from third ,  alongside rikknen .  kubica was passed by massa into the first corner ,  and then by rikknen on the third lap .  the ferraris dominated at the front of the race ,  leading to their one two finish .  hamilton had a slow start after almost stalling on the grid ,  and dropped back to ninth .  the mclaren driver ran into the back of fernando alonso s renault a lap later ,  breaking off the mclaren s front wing and dropping hamilton to the back of the field .  kubica s strong finish promoted bmw sauber to the lead in the constructors championship ,  after bmw driver nick heidfeld finished fourth .  ferrari and mclaren trailed ,  one and two points behind ,  respectively .  rikknen took the lead in the drivers championship ,  with points ,  three points ahead of heidfeld and five ahead of hamilton ,  kubica and kovalainen ,  with races remaining in the season .  a week before the start of the grand prix weekend ,  the news of the world alleged that max mosley ,  the president of formula one s governing body ,  the fdration internationale de l automobile fia ,  had engaged in sexual acts with five prostitutes .  while mosley denied the allegations ,  he cancelled his scheduled appearance at the bahrain grand prix .  several teams condemned mosley s alleged actions and asked for his resignation ,  and while for a time the controversy threatened to overshadow the race ,  mosley eventually retained his position and successfully sued the news of the world for the report .  the qualifying session on saturday afternoon was split into three parts .  the first part ran for minutes ,  and cars that finished the session th position or lower were eliminated from qualifying .  the second part of the qualifying session lasted minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions to .  the final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth ,  and decided pole position .  cars which failed to make the final session could refuel before the race ,  so ran lighter in those sessions .  cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race ,  and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions .  the weather and conditions on the grid were before dry for the race .  the air temperature was c f with signs of a breeze which could blow sand onto the track and impede the cars grip .  massa got the best start of the frontrunners off the line ,  as he passed kubica into the first corner to take the lead .  hamilton s poor start caused his anti stall system to kick in ,  and he was passed by six drivers to fall back to ninth .  rikknen benefited from hamilton s start by moving up to third ,  ahead of kovalainen ,  trulli and heidfeld .  as massa extended his lead at the front of the race ,  hamilton ,  who trailed alonso ,  collided with the back of the renault ,  knocking the mclaren s front wing off the car .  suffering handling difficulties ,  hamilton returned to the pit lane for a new nose section ,  and rejoined in th place .  rikknen took second place when he passed kubica on lap three heidfeld took fourth when he passed trulli and kovalainen in separate manoeuvres .  further down the field ,  vettel retired from the race on the first lap after twice colliding with other cars button ,  sutil and coulthard pitted to repair early damage .  by lap ,  massa had opened his lead over rikknen to .  seconds ,  ahead of kubica ,  heidfeld ,  kovalainen and trulli .  kubica was the first of the frontrunners to pit ,  on lap .  rikknen and trulli followed on lap massa pitted from the lead one lap later .  following the first round of pit stops ,  the gap between the ferraris was .  seconds ,  however by lap rikknen had closed to within four seconds of his teammate .  massa held a .  second lead over rikknen when the two ferraris pitted for the final time on laps and ,  respectively ,  and massa retained his lead into the final stint .  kubica pitted on lap ,  heidfeld on lap ,  and kovalainen on lap .  rikknen s second placed finish gave him a three point lead over heidfeld in the drivers championship ,  with points ,  ahead of hamilton ,  kubica

sol was one of four sister ships that carried cargo and a limited number of passengers for the morgan line .  she was acquired by the u . s .  army after the united states entered world war i in april ,  and converted to carry horses and mules to france .  in august ,  the ship was transferred to the u . s .  navy and continued transporting animals through the end of the war .  el sol returned to the morgan line in and sailed with them until march ,  when she sank in new york harbor after colliding with sac city of the american diamond line .  a portion of the ship s cargo was salvaged but the ship was scrapped later in the year .  hoover dam ,  once known as boulder dam ,  is a concrete arch gravity dam in the black canyon of the colorado river ,  on the border between the u . s .  states of nevada and arizona .  it was constructed between and during the great depression and was dedicated on september ,  by president franklin d .  roosevelt .  its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers ,  and cost over one hundred lives .  the dam was controversially named after president herbert hoover .  as the technology of electric power transmission improved ,  the lower colorado was considered for its hydroelectric power potential .  in ,  the edison electric company of los angeles surveyed the river in the hope of building a foot m rock dam which could generate ,  horsepower ,  kw .  however ,  at the time ,  the limit of transmission of electric power was miles km ,  and there were few customers mostly mines within that limit .  edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapse including an option for what became the site of hoover dam .  in the following years ,  the bureau of reclamation bor ,  known as the reclamation service at the time ,  also considered the lower colorado as the site for a dam .  service chief arthur powell davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of boulder canyon ,  miles km north of the eventual dam site ,  into the river .  the river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris ,  and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble .  in ,  after considering it for several years ,  the reclamation service finally rejected the proposal ,  citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money .  on january ,  the bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties ,  at five dollars a copy .  the government was to provide the materials but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam .  the dam was described in minute detail ,  covering pages of text and drawings .  a million bid bond was to accompany each bid the winner would have to post a million performance bond .  the contractor had seven years to build the dam ,  or penalties would ensue .  before the dam could be built ,  the colorado river needed to be diverted away from the construction site .  to accomplish this ,  four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls ,  two on the nevada side and two on the arizona side .  these tunnels were ft m in diameter .  their combined length was nearly ,  ft ,  or more than miles km .  the contract required these tunnels to be completed by october ,  with a ,  per day fine to be assessed for any delay .  to meet the deadline ,  six companies had to complete work by early ,  since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert .  to protect the construction site from the colorado river and to facilitate the river s diversion ,  two cofferdams were constructed .  work on the upper cofferdam began in september ,  even though the river had not yet been diverted .  the cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work ,  and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself .  the upper cofferdam was ft m high ,  and feet m thick at its base ,  as thicker than the dam itself .  it contained ,  cubic yards ,  m of material .  with most work finished on the dam itself the powerhouse remained uncompleted ,  a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for september ,  to coincide with a western tour being made by president franklin d .  roosevelt .  the morning of the dedication ,  it was moved forward three hours from p . m .  pacific time to a . m .  this was done because secretary of the interior harold l .  ickes had reserved a radio slot for the president for p . m .  but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for p . m .  eastern time .  despite the change in the ceremony time ,  and temperatures of f c ,  people were present for the president s speech in which he avoided mentioning the name of former president hoover ,  who was not invited to the ceremony .  to mark the occasion ,  a three cent stamp was issued by the united states post office department bearing the name boulder dam ,  the official name of the dam between and .  after the ceremony ,  roosevelt made the first visit by any american president to las vegas .  not included in the official fatalities number were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia .  workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning ,  brought on by the use of gasoline fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels ,  and a classification used by six companies to avoid paying compensation claims .  the site s diversion tunnels frequently reached f c ,  enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases .  a total of workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning .  no deaths of non workers from pneumonia were recorded in boulder city during the construction period .  prior to abby s landfall in texas ,  gale warnings were issued for the coast and residents on matagorda island were evacuated .  overall ,  the storm s impacts were limited due to its small size .  only two structures sustained damage in matagorda ,  one being destroyed by a possible tornado ,  and the remaining effects resulted from flooding in jackson and victoria counties .  total damage from the storm was estimated at ,  with the majority stemming from crops .  abby s small size resulted in its effects being limited to areas within the immediate track .  sustained winds of mph km h with gusts to mph km h were measured by the army corps of engineers in matagorda .  near the town ,  a possible tornado unroofed a barn and tossed the structure ft m this building previously had withstood the effects of hurricane carla in .  winds estimated at mph km h tore part of the roof off a fishing warehouse in matagorda itself .  along the coast ,  tides ranged from to ft .  to .  m above normal from matagorda to freeport .  four men and five dogs required rescue after their vessel became stranded on the colorado river .  during the bush war ,  the rhodesian army augmented its ranks with foreign volunteers ,  who were accepted into regular regiments with the same pay and conditions of service as locals .  most foreign recruits enlisted in the rhodesian light infantry rli ,  which launched an overseas recruitment programme in ,  but required successful applicants to speak good english .  the army attempted to alleviate the strain on its troops during late by recruiting french speakers as well ,  and formed a designated company in the rhodesia regiment for them .  the regiment already had six independent companies ,  so the francophone unit became independent company .  the first dent to morale came after about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the rhodesian army .  in the eyes of some of the french speaking soldiers ,  the ranks assigned appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors ,  and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training ,  ability and experience .  some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline .  the brazen attitude of most of the company s soldiers jarred strongly with that of their rhodesian commanders ,  who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the frenchmen had little inclination to meet .  as chen was born in a culture other than the culture he now lives in ,  he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people .  his goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire emotional responses in the player that other games are lacking .  although he and thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games ,  he does not plan on commercially developing any of them ,  as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer .  after flower was released to critical praise and awards ,  chen and thatgamecompany moved on to their next game ,  journey .  journey was intended by chen to focus on the element of communication and social interaction in video games .  since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals ,  in journey chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players ,  but not be able to communicate

just north of due west and kept this motion through the remainder of its existence .  the depression rapidly intensified as it moved to the west ,  becoming tropical storm jose just six hours later .

and made landfall in the state of veracruz early on august with winds reaching a peak of mph km h .  as jose made its landfall an eye was beginning to form ,  although the storm was still well short of hurricane intensity .  tropical storm jose quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated that afternoon in the mountains of central mexico only hours after forming .  as tropical storm jose formed so close to shore there was a lead time of less than hours on the tropical storm warning for the veracruz coastline .  the area covered by the warning issued on august was extended southwards as jose intensified ,  before being canceled soon after landfall on august .  the advisories issued by the national hurricane center emphasized that rainfall from jose was the primary threat .  the actor s

tennessee was featured in both hannah montana the movie and its soundtrack .  cyrus recorded back to tennessee for the film hannah montana the movie ,  in which his character performs the song at a fundraiser to save the meadows near his hometown from development .  cyrus says the song is part of the cornerstone of the film because it reflects the film s theme of escaping the fast paced ,  glitzy world of hollywood in search of a simpler country lifestyle .  cyrus commented ,  when i see the video for back to tennessee ,  there s a lot of emotion there .  it s a combination between the hannah montana movie and going back to the actual spot where i wrote the song .  i wrote the song in malibu ,  and we went back to malibu to film the video .  i had never done a video exactly where i wrote the song .  then we take my little blue truck from the movie and travel back across the country .  again ,  it becomes a very articulate picture of what that song s about .  it s everything a video is supposed to be .  the entire highway was on the emmet cheboygan county line .  various segments of maps are scattered around the galleon ,  which will form a complete view of the game s

been flawed and the judge s instructions to the jury had been confusing in relation to conviction and sentencing ,  whether racial bias in jury selection existed to an extent tending to produce an inherently biased jury and therefore an unfair trial the batson claim in relation to post conviction review hearings in ,  whether the presiding judge ,  who had also presided at the trial ,

ruler of the fifth dynasty in the late th century to mid th century bce ,  during the old kingdom period .  djedkare succeeded menkauhor kaiu and was in turn succeeded by unas .  his relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain ,  although it is often conjectured that unas was djedkare s son owing to the smooth transition between the two .  the relative chronological position of djedkare isesi as the eighth and penultimate ruler of the fifth dynasty ,  succeeding menkauhor kaiu and preceding unas on the throne ,  is well established by historical sources and confirmed by archaeological evidence .  djedkare may have left some of his monuments unfinished at his death ,  as suggested by several relief bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the pyramid of king unas .  their original setting remains unknown .  djedkare probably also exploited gold mines in the eastern desert and in nubia indeed ,  the earliest mention of the land of gold an ancient egyptian term for nubia is found in an inscription from the mortuary temple of djedkare isesi .  the reforms of djedkare isesi played an important role in flourishing of the arts during the later old kingdom ,  as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond the king .  this created a surge in the number of commissions leading to a general improvement of the artistic works .  this also provided the artisans with a new wealth ,  which they used to build their own large funerary complexes .  more generally ,  an historical or literary tradition concerning events in the time of djedkare seems to have flourished toward the end of old kingdom as can be inferred from the tombs of harkuf and iny .  these two officials were in charge of expeditions to foreign lands punt and byblos under merenre i and pepi ii and both relate similar expeditions that took place during the time of djedkare isesi .  de was originally designated along foulk road in the s .  in the s

to compensate for the lack of budget ,  a very tight shooting schedule was planned over days ,  during which kenneth branagh was only available for two weeks and was performing on stage nightly in london .  howard blake recalls i went to a viewing and saw that the film was very profound ,  with a serious anti war theme ,  but a certain amount of found choral music had already been laid in by the editors .  i explained that i loved the film and i thought the choral orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and i felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small and that i could only hear this in my head as done by strings only .  blake decided to compose his score to match the key of the schubert mass ,  in order for the music to continue seamlessly .  however ,  during the recording session with his orchestra ,  the sinfonia of london ,  he found that the schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat ,  and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key .  the fruit bodies of hydnellum peckii are found growing solitary ,  scattered ,  or clustered together on the ground under conifers ,

has closed .  a preference for mountainous or subalpine ecosystems has been noted .  the fungus has a wide distribution in north america ,  and is particularly common in the pacific northwest its range extends north to alaska and east to north carolina .  in the puget sound area of the u . s .  state of washington ,  it is found in association with douglas fir ,  fir ,  and hemlock .  along the oregon coast it has been collected under lodgepole pine .  in addition to north america ,  the mushroom is widespread in europe ,  and its presence has been documented in italy ,  germany ,  and scotland .  the species is common in the latter location ,  but becoming increasingly rare in several european countries ,  such as norway ,  the netherlands ,  and the czech republic .  increased pollution in central europe has been suggested as one possible factor in the mushroom s decline there .  reports from iran in and korea in were the first outside europe and north america .  gregory

part of new york state route ,  a highway that continued north from moravia to syracuse .  ny was assigned as part of the renumbering of state highways in new york ,  utilizing all of pre ny ,  the freeville moravia portion of ny ,  and a previously unnumbered highway north to sterling .  originally ,  ny extended south into the village of owego by way of an overlap with ny .  it was truncated to its current southern terminus by .  the amount of homes along the route begins to increase as ny approaches the village of newark valley .  just south of the village limits ,  ny intersects ny b ,  a spur leading to ny in maine .  the route continues into the small village as south main street and passes by several blocks of homes and commercial buildings .  at water street ,  ny becomes north main street however ,  from this point north ,  most of the village is situated on the opposite bank of owego creek .  as a result ,  ny continues through the village limits but passes very few buildings before seamlessly exiting the community and entering another rural area .  ny clips the extreme southwestern corner of cortland county as a result ,  only .  miles .  km of the route is located within the county .  just north of the county line ,  the route meets ny in the hamlet of harford mills .  ny is little more than an alternate route to ny ,  which ny meets in the hamlet of harford .  miles .  km to the northeast .  in between harford mills and harford ,  the east branch of owego creek separates from ny and heads north to follow ny instead .  ny continues northwest out of harford hamlet and into tompkins county .  the overlap between ny and ny ends at the northern village line .  at this point ,  ny continues north while ny forks to the west ,  running along the village limits on freeville road for about mile .  km through an area with only a handful of homes .  while doing so ,  the route passes to the south of the dryden middle and high school complex .  ny heads onward through an open ,  undeveloped area ,  curving to the northwest and eventually to the north as it approaches the village of freeville ,  where it serves the william george agency for children s services at the southern village line .  it remains on freeville road until railroad street ,  where it turns west and proceeds into the densely populated village center .  here ,  it intersects the eastern terminus of ny at a junction situated adjacent to fall creek .  cayuga county ,  located in the finger lakes region of new york ,  has a highly unorthodox shape .  most of the county is only about miles km wide from its western border to its eastern edge .  from north to south ,  however ,  it extends from locke north to the lake ontario shoreline a distance of about miles km .  ny passes through much of the county ,  ending about miles km south of the shoreline in sterling .  as a result ,  over half of ny s routing is located in the county ,  with the midpoint located near the city of auburn .  as ny enters auburn ,  it passes by auburn high school before heading north through densely populated blocks filled with homes .  the divided highway ends abruptly at swift street ,  where ny turns west to follow the two lane undivided swift street west for seven blocks to ny south street .  here ,  ny leaves swift street and joins ny on south street .  the two routes follow south street past the william h .  seward house into downtown auburn ,  where the homes are replaced with businesses at lincoln street .  three blocks later ,  south street intersects with the east arterial eastbound us and ny .  the overlap between ny and ny ends one block later at the west arterial westbound us and ny ,  where ny turns to follow the arterial for a block to the west .  several portions of modern ny were originally part of turnpikes and plank roads during the s .  on april ,  the new york state legislature passed a law incorporating the cortland and owego turnpike company .  the company was tasked with building a highway the cortland and owego turnpike from owego north to the then village of cortland .  it roughly followed what is now ny north from owego to the vicinity of harford ,  where it turned north to access virgil .  it continued to cortland by way of modern ny .  on april ,  the legislature chartered the auburn and port byron turnpike company .  the auburn and port byron turnpike began at the auburn state prison in auburn and proceeded northward along the routing of ny to meet the north branch of the seneca turnpike in the town of brutus now throop .  from there ,  the turnpike continued on ny through port byron to the seneca river ,  where it ended at a bridge crossing the river at mosquito point .  in ,  the auburn and moravia plank road company was incorporated .  they were tasked with connecting moravia to auburn by way of a plank road along the western side of owasco lake now ny .  ny b .  miles or .  kilometres is a short spur in broome and tioga counties connecting ny in newark valley in the west to ny in maine in the east .  it was assigned in the early s .  the assembly had already done significant work on a catechism between december and january containing fifty five questions ,  before it decided to create two catechisms rather than one .  the larger catechism ,  intended to assist ministers in teaching the reformed faith to their congregations .  the shorter catechism was based on the larger catechism but intended for use in teaching the faith to children .  parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well .  the scots general assembly approved both catechisms in .  covenant theology is an interpretive framework used by reformed theologians which was significantly developed during the seventeenth century .  under this scheme ,  as articulated by the assembly ,  god s dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants the covenant of works and covenant of grace .  the westminster confession was the first major reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works sometimes called the covenant of life ,  in which god offered adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience .  in the fall of man ,  adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil .  to remedy this ,  god offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace .  this covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey god s law perfectly .  the idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox reformed theology .  the westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which god deals with people .  the puzzle is considered by many gamers and publications to be one of the most challenging video game puzzles of all time .  broken sword creator and revolution ceo charles cecil and broken sword designer steve ince ,  as well as publications which have covered it ,  explain that the puzzle was challenging because the player was not met with any time critical puzzle prior to this point in the game ,  which would mean they would not necessarily make the connection that clicking on the machinery at a key moment would make this happen .  some of the matches were changed after they were first announced ,  as several wrestlers left the wwf shortly before the event .  critics have praised the main event and the tag team match that was won by savage and perfect .  although the remaining bouts have received low ratings ,  critics have felt that those two matches made the event worth watching .  at summerslam in august ,  the undertaker defeated kamala .  harvey wippleman ,  kamala s manager wanted revenge ,  so a rematch was scheduled for survivor series .  the match was promoted as the wwf s first coffin match ,  in which the winner would place the loser in a coffin after the match .  survivor series was attended by ,  fans ,  the same number as the previous year .  it drew more fans than any of the following three survivor series event would draw .  the pay per view buyrate was ,  which means that .

consciousness by master craftsmen as pamela mccorduck writes ,  ai began with an ancient wish to forge the gods .  the seeds of modern ai were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols .  this work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the s ,  a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning .  this device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain .  in the s and s ,  a handful of scientists from a variety of fields mathematics ,  psychology ,  engineering ,  economics and political science began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain .  the field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in .  when access to digital computers became possible in the middle fifties ,  a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought .  this was a new approach to creating thinking machines .  there were many successful programs and new directions in the late s and s .  among the most influential were these the first generation of ai researchers made these predictions about their work ,  h .  a .  simon and allen newell within ten years a digital computer will be the world s chess champion and within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem ,  h .  a .  simon machines will be capable ,  within twenty years ,  of doing any work a man can do ,  marvin minsky within a generation .  the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved ,  marvin minsky in life magazine in from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being .  in the s a form of ai program called expert systems was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream ai research .  in those same years ,  the japanese government aggressively funded ai with its fifth generation computer project .  another encouraging event in the early s was the revival of connectionism in the work of john hopfield and david rumelhart .  once again ,  ai had achieved success .  expert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place .  all in all ,  the programs proved to be useful something that ai had not been able to achieve up to this point .  the business community s fascination with ai rose and fell in the s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble .  the collapse was in the perception of ai by government agencies and investors the field continued to make advances despite the criticism .  rodney brooks and hans moravec ,  researchers from the related field of robotics ,  argued for an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence .  in the late s ,  the strategic computing initiative cut funding to ai deeply and brutally .  new leadership at darpa had decided that ai was not the next wave and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results .  by ,  the impressive list of goals penned in for japan s fifth generation project had not been met .  indeed ,  some of them ,  like carry on a casual conversation had not been met by .  as with other ai projects ,  expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible .  on may ,  deep blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion ,  garry kasparov .  the super computer was a specialized version of a framework produced by ibm ,  and was capable of processing twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match which deep blue had lost ,  reportedly ,  moves per second .  the event was broadcast live over the internet and received over million hits .  these successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm ,  but mostly on the tedious application of engineering skill and on the tremendous power of computers today .  in fact ,  deep blue s computer was million times faster than the ferranti mark that christopher strachey taught to play chess in .  this dramatic increase is measured by moore s law ,  which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years .  the fundamental problem of raw computer power was slowly being overcome .  in ,  arthur c .  clarke and stanley kubrick had imagined that by the year ,  a machine would exist with an intelligence that matched or exceeded the capability of human beings .  the character they created ,  hal ,  was based on a belief shared by many leading ai researchers that such a machine would exist by the year .  cyclone graham of the australian region cyclone season was a weak tropical storm that affected australia during late february and early march .  graham originated from an area of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over australia on february .  the interaction with a monsoon trough formed an area of low pressure that developed into tropical cyclone graham on february .  the storm moved slowly to the east southeast ,  and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on western australia the next day .  the cyclone weakened as it moved inland ,  and dissipated on march .  the storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds ,  which produced flooding and downed trees .  one fatality occurred ,  though no significant damages were reported .  following the storm ,  the name graham was retired from the australian region basin .  the second of two

liberation front launched a large scale operation ,  holding its ground and fighting for four days against government troops equipped with armor ,  artillery and helicopters ,  and aided by u . s .  air support and military advisers .  the viet cong demonstrated that ,  when well supplied with military supplies from north vietnam ,  they had the ability to fight and inflict damage even on the best arvn units .  for the first time in their history ,  the nlf was able to control a government stronghold for several days ,  and inflict heavy casualties on regular units of the south vietnamese army in a large set piece battle .  unlike their adversaries ,  the south vietnamese military suffered heavily in their attempts to recapture the village of bnh gi and secure the surrounding areas .  the south vietnamese and their american allies lost the total of about personnel killed in action ,  wounded and missing .  in just four days of fighting ,  two of south vietnam s elite ranger companies were destroyed and several others suffered heavy losses ,  while the th marine battalion was rendered ineffective as a fighting force .  at that stage of the war ,  bnh gi was the worst defeat experienced by any south vietnamese army .  despite the humiliating defeat inflicted on them ,  the south vietnamese army stubbornly considered the battle as their victory and erected a monument at the site of the battle to acknowledge the sacrifices of the soldiers who had fallen to retake bnh gi .  th battalion th company th artillery detachment st airborne battalion rd airborne

of violence even further .  in late may and june ,  serbs had been rounded up ,  tortured and killed in nevesinje ,  and in early june ,  another serbs had been killed at ljubinje .  in response ,  serbs attacked ustae officials and facilities ,  and conducted raids themselves ,  killing muslim villagers .  the first indication that the situation had changed significantly was on june ,  when a group of ustae clashed with a group of rebels they estimated to number between and ,  .  after an extended firefight near the village of stepen ,  km .  mi north of korita ,  during which they suffered several casualties ,  the ustae also burned down four villages .  they then entered two muslim majority villages in the area and arrested serbs who had not been involved in the earlier fighting .  the arrested serbs were transported north to avtovac and shot .  that night ,  all adult serbs above the age of in gacko ,  .  km .  mi northwest of avtovac ,  were arrested ,  and were immediately shot .  the rest were transported km mi west to a camp in nevesinje .  over the period june ,  serbs from the village of ravno ,  km mi southwest of ljubinje ,  were arrested and killed at the gendarmerie post ,  and the remainder of the population fled to the hills .  around gacko and avtovac in the north ,  the day had been quiet .  when the commander of the nd company of the th battalion at gacko reported rebels gathering near the town ,  prpi sent a truck mounted platoon with an ammunition resupply .  the platoon was ambushed en route ,  with home guardsmen being captured .  gacko was reinforced later in the day from troops in avtovac .  on the night of june ,  the nevesinje garrison was subjected to a sustained attack by the rebels ,  but held out .  on june ,  laxa became the overall commander of all ndh authorities in hum and dubrava counties ,  which included ustae ,  home guard ,  civil administration ,  gendarmerie and police .  military courts were established to deal with those resisting the ndh authorities .  armed guards were posted at the entrance to towns and villages ,  and any armed civilians were to be disarmed and brought to military authorities .  laxa issued an order that gave the rebels until july to submit to the authorities .  on that day ,  after the prohaska group broke through to nevesinje from mostar ,  prohaska sent a company of the th battalion to kifino selo to meet the two companies of the th battalion advancing from pluine .  despite zndh air support ,  the company of the th battalion was attacked by rebels near the entrance to kifino selo and the majority broke and ran .  prohaska had to send reserves to block the road between nevesinje and kifino selo ,  and the companies from the th battalion began to reconnoitre the rebel positions towards odak .  crush s primary gameplay feature involves manipulating each game level between d and d views ,  allowing the player to reach platforms and locations inaccessible from within a different view .  this element was noted by critics to be similar to one in super paper mario ,  also released in ,  though the zo mode team had envisioned the concept five years prior .  crush received positive reviews upon release ,  with critics praising its incorporation of this dimension shifting component alongside other aspects of the game presentation .  though crush won several gaming awards ,  including psp game of the month ,  it failed to meet the developer s sales expectations .  a port of the game for the nintendo ds called crush d was announced on january ,  and was made available on january ,  in europe and on march ,  in north america .  while crush and its nintendo ds port crush d retain the same gameplay mechanics and premise ,  the two versions feature different plots .  note the voice actors for the story are unknown at the moment as zo mode never credited them in an interview ,  zo mode executive producer paul mottram claimed that the game concept was envisioned in ,  but work did not actually begin until .  the initial concept was built on the crushing mechanism between d and d ,  and they only had to create appropriate obstacles to prevent players from simply crushing across the level .  mottram noted that during the development of crush ,  the gameplay of super paper mario had not yet been revealed ,  and thus the team was surprised to learn that it shared a similar feature .  the album produced four singles .  the most successful ,  my happiness ,  reached on the aria singles chart ,  won the aria music award

january ,  was a professional baseball pitcher who played in major league baseball mlb from through .  early in his career ,  sisler was a starter ,  then later was used as a middle reliever and occasionally as a closer .  he reached the majors in with the boston red sox after he completed a two year obligation in the active military .  after three and a half seasons with the red sox ,  he was traded to the detroit tigers in and served the team through the season .  before the season ,  he was selected by the washington senators in the major league baseball expansion draft ,  for whom he played the season .  he was then traded to the cincinnati reds in ,  playing one season at the major league level ,  and one in their minor league system .  his most productive years came with boston ,  where he won games from to ,  averaging innings each season .  after that ,  he appeared strictly as a reliever and saved a career high games for the senators .  in a seven season career ,  sisler posted a record with a .  era in appearances ,  including saves ,  complete games ,  one shutout and innings .  sisler retired from baseball after the season to become an investment firm

started again at clearwater ,  and after a brief stint in reading ,  he was promoted to the scranton wilkes barre red barons of the class aaa international league .  in three games at scranton ,  he struck out batters while giving up only one walk and one run .  his minor league statistics included a record of with a .  era and strikeouts in games pitched .  for his performance ,  the phillies promoted him to the major league club .  though hamels was the clear cut ace ,  charlie manuel penciled in brett myers as the phillies opening day starter because myers accepted his role as closer the preceding season ,  putting the team ahead of his personal wishes to start .  hamels was selected the phillies starter for game of the world series the phillies won ,  and hamels earned his fourth win of the postseason .  hamels also started game ,  which was suspended due to rain after the top of the sixth inning tied at ,  and receiving a no decision when game five resumed the phillies won to clinch the world series .  overall ,  hamels made five postseason starts in ,  going with a .  era .  hamels threw a total of innings during the postseason ,  and held opponents scoreless in of them

finished eighth in the nl cy young award voting .  his .  era ranked second best in his career behind only his .  era in .  the philadelphia chapter of the baseball writers association of america presented him the steve carlton most valuable pitcher award .  despite hamels poor record and era ,  of his starts were quality starts ,  and thus he gave his team a chance to win times ,  yet only got eight wins .  despite lack of run support contributing to a poor win loss record ,  hamels was among the best pitchers in the national league ,  and was even mentioned as a cy young candidate .  on september ,  hamels pitched six innings of a phillies combined no hitter against the atlanta braves .  hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter in the top of the seventh due to having five walks ,  a hit batter ,  and pitches through six innings .  overall ,  hamels was the only consistent star on the phillies ,  finished sixth in cy young voting ,  and was frequently mentioned as a candidate to be traded in the offseason to bolster the phillies lackluster farm system ,  after he avoided being dealt at the july trading deadline .  at the start of the season ,  there was much focus and speculation regarding trade possibilities surrounding hamels .  the boston red sox ,  los angeles dodgers ,  texas rangers ,  chicago cubs ,  new york yankees ,  and san francisco giants expressed interest in trading for him during the season .  the rangers lost to the toronto blue jays in five games in the division series after squandering a series lead .  hamels received a no decision in game as he left the game tied ,  but the rangers won in innings .  hamels started game ,  and was pulled in the bottom of the th inning while the rangers were leading the jays subsequently scored runs to win ,  and hamels was charged with the loss as he was responsible for the runners on base .  kyra ,  also known by her title the seer ,  is a fictional character from the american television

reporting the possibility of carpenter becoming a series regular .  no fossil remains of dodo like birds have ever been found on runion .  a few later sources take issue with the proposed ibis identity of the solitaire ,  and have even regarded the white dodo as a valid species .  british writer errol fuller agrees that the th century paintings do not depict runion birds ,  but has questioned whether the ibis subfossils are necessarily connected to the solitaire accounts .  he notes that no evidence indicates the extinct ibis survived until the time europeans reached runion .  cheke and hume have dismissed such sentiments as being mere belief and hope in the existence of a dodo on the island .  contemporary accounts described the species as having white and grey plumage merging into yellow ,  black wing tips and tail feathers ,  a long neck and legs ,  and limited flight capabilities .  sieur dubois account is the most detailed contemporary description of the bird ,  here as translated by hugh strickland in over the next few days ,  khnh embarked on a media offensive ,  repeatedly criticizing u . s .  policy and decrying what he saw as an undue influence and infringement on vietnamese sovereignty ,  explicitly condemning taylor and declaring the nation s independence from foreign manipulation .  khnh and the young turks began preparations to expel taylor before changing their minds however ,  khnh s misleading tactics had rallied the young turks around his fragile leadership for at least the short term future .  the americans were forced to back down on their insistence that the hnc be restored and did not carry through on taylor s threats to cut off aid ,  despite saigon s defiance .  at this point ,  khnh had not spoken up and allowed the impression that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will ,  and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves .  hng had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the hnc ,  as both he and the young turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over khnh .  on the morning of december ,  as part of his order of the day ,  a regular message to the armed forces over radio vietnam ,  khnh went back on his promise to leave the country and announced ,  we make sacrifices for the country s independence and the vietnamese people s liberty ,  but not to carry out the policy of any foreign country .  he said it was better to live poor but proud as free citizens of an independent country rather than in ease and shame as slaves of the foreigners and communists .  khnh pledged support for both hng and suu s civilian rule ,  and condemned colonialism in a thinly veiled reference to the us .  the national league wild card tie breaker game was a one game extension to major league baseball s mlb regular season ,  played between the chicago cubs and san francisco giants to determine the winner of the national league nl wild card .  the game took place at wrigley field in chicago ,  on september ,  .  the cubs won the game ,  holding the giants scoreless for the majority of the game until the giants threatened heavily in the ninth inning and scored all three of their runs .  as a result of the game ,  the cubs qualified for the postseason and the giants did not .  the mets were tied with the cubs and giants in the wild card race as late in the season as september at .  however ,  the mets lost their remaining two games and finished their season one game back of the cubs and giants who ended tied at .  this record was also the best non division winning record and as such a tie breaker was necessary to determine the wild card winner .  a coin flip on september gave the cubs home field advantage ,  setting wrigley field as the location for the game .  in the event of a three way tie the cubs were presented with the choice to either host two home games or receive a bye and play the winner of a mets giants game on the road because they had the best combined record against the mets and giants .  cubs general manager ed lynch decided on the second option ,  though the choice was moot as the mets fell out of the race .  the cubs steve trachsel and mark gardner of the giants were slated to start the tie breaker on the september .  box score for monday september ,  p . m .  ct at wrigley field in chicago corpus christi bay has a rich history of human settlement along its shores that dates back millennia and is responsible for the growth of corpus christi ,  and the smaller ports of ingleside and portland .  it is an important natural estuary that supports a diverse collection of wildlife ,  and attracts many tourists .  the bay s abundance of petroleum and natural gas has attracted industry ,  and its strategic location on the texas coast is ideal for military establishment .  tropical depression one e moved slowly to the northwest while strengthening slowly due to easterly vertical wind shear .  the depression was upgraded to tropical storm alma on may .  the storm quickly strengthened once the vertical wind shear relaxed and was near hurricane force by the morning of may .  hurricane alma reached its peak intensity early on may with maximum sustained winds of mph km h .  the hurricane entered an area of southwesterly wind shear caused by an upper level ridge of high pressure .  the increasing vertical wind shear and cooler water caused alma to weaken to a tropical storm .  on may ,  the storm continued to weaken and became a depression .  the next day ,  the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone well west of mainland mexico .  alma became the earliest named storm and hurricane in the satellite era in the east pacific proper .  a tropical wave emerged into the atlantic ocean off the coast of africa on may .  the wave moved across central america into the northeastern pacific ocean ,  where convection organized with the system on june .  the system became well enough organized to be upgraded to tropical depression three e on june ,  while mi ,  km south of the southern tip of baja california .  the depression continued to strengthen ,  and was upgraded to tropical storm cristina on june .  cristina initially had well established upper level outflow .  it failed to reach hurricane status ,  peaking with maximum sustained winds of mph km h due to movement of its associated upper level anticyclone to the north over mexico which caused cristina to be exposed to easterly vertical wind shear .  cristina moved generally northwestward ,  which eventually placed the storm in cooler waters ,  and caused the deep convection of the system to dissipate .  on june ,  cristina diminished to a tropical depression .  cristina moved west northwestward with the low level flow .  the depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on june ,  after a lack of deep convection for hours .  a tropical wave came off the coast of africa into the eastern atlantic ocean on june and .  the system moved across the atlantic and entered into the northeastern pacific ocean .  the wave became a significant tropical system ,  with cyclonic turning in the lower and middle layers of the system s cloudiness on june .  the center of circulation was located mi km south of acapulco ,  mexico .  the system exhibited sufficient organization to be considered tropical depression five e on june .  the depression quickly strengthened and became tropical storm elida later that day .  the track of elida was west northwestward to northwestward from june through june .  some rainbands moved over the mountainous region of southwestern mexico ,  but no flooding ,  damage ,  or casualties were reported as a result .  elida continued strengthening and it was upgraded to a hurricane early on june passing directly over socorro island later in the day ,  right as elida reached peak strength of mph km h ,  dropping .  in mm of rain on the island .  some windows broke also as a result ,  and minor structural damage was reported as a result on the island .  an area of disturbed weather south of acapulco organized into tropical depression six e on june and the system began to move northwest .  originally the system was expected to reach tropical storm strength and near hurricane intensity by late on july or early on july ,  however persistent vertical wind shear over the system impeded its development .  after convection began to merge into the intertropical convergence zone itcz ,  the national hurricane center discontinued advisories on tropical depression six e ,  stating that the depression dissipated ,  and regeneration seemed unlikely .  a tropical wave came off the northwest coast of africa on june .  the wave crossed the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea ,  into the warm waters of the northeastern pacific ocean ,  on july .  an area of disturbed weather moved northwards towards the gulf of tehuantepec and became tropical depression seven e early on july .  the depression moved northwest ,  and because of increased organization of deep convection ,  was designated tropical storm fausto on july ,  mi km south of manzanillo ,  mexico .  a weakly defined eye formed on july ,  and the storm was upgraded to hurricane fausto ,  mi km south of cabo san lucas .  fausto peaked in strength with winds of mph km h and a central pressure of mb .  inhg on july .  fausto passed mi km north of socorro island causing a northwest wind of mph km h ,  and .  in mm of rain at that location .  the hurricane fluctuated in intensity on july ,  before weakening into a tropical storm later that day ,  mi km west of cabo san lucas .  the weakening fausto moved over continuing cooler waters ,  and was downgraded to a tropical depression on june ,  mi ,  km west of cabo san lucas .  the depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on june ,  and its low level circulation of clouds persisted for a few days .  a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on june and moved across the atlantic ocean and central caribbean sea with little development .  within the western caribbean sea ,  convection developed with the wave on july .  the system became better organized as it moved into the northeastern pacific ocean .  the system was upgraded to tropical depression eight e on july .  the depression moved west northwest ,  with a good outflow to the north ,  and gradually strengthened into tropical storm genevieve later that day .  genevieve continued to strengthen ,  reaching hurricane strength on july .  the storm approached within mi km of socorro island where a sustained wind of mph km h and gust of mph km h were reported ,  before the weather equipment on the island failed .  hernan kept category hurricane intensity a few more days and hurricane strength for six days overall .  the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on july as it moved over cooler waters .  hernan turned more to the west as its low level center became separated from its thunderstorm activity and was steering by a surface high pressure system to its north .  hernan moved over cooler waters ,  dissipating as a tropical cyclone early on july .  on july a tropical disturbance behind hurricane hernan strengthened into a tropical depression .  due to the close proximity of hernan to its west ,  the development of the depression was hindered due to vertical wind shear from the outflow of hernan .  this wind shear dissipated the depression on july ,  and its remnants were absorbed by the nearby cyclone .  no damages or casualties were caused by the depression as it was well out to sea .  tropical storm aka was the only tropical storm to form in the central north pacific during .  an area of disturbed weather began to organize on august .  by august ,  the system became well enough organized to become designated tropical depression one c .  the depression intensified into a tropical storm while moving west ,  to the south of the hawaiian islands .  on august ,  tropical storm aka peaked with maximum sustained winds of mph km h .  the storm continued to move west and approached johnston island ,  though the island s weather did not deteriorate .  the tropical storm crossed the international date line on august .  aka weakened back into a depression and dissipated two days later on august .  hurricane diana struck eastern mexico and managed to hold together ,  remaining a tropical depression as it entered the eastern pacific ocean late on august .  although tropical depression diana entered the eastern pacific ,  the national hurricane center did not re classify the system .  no re intensification occurred after the system entered the eastern pacific ,  and it had dissipated as a tropical cyclone by the following day .  the remnant tropical disturbance recurved through the gulf of california while developing significant convection before it moved into northwest mexico ,  which brought rainfall amounts of over in mm to local areas within the state of sonora .  the remnant disturbance moved into the american southwest on august .  tropical depression two c was the second and last tropical cyclone to develop within the north central pacific ocean in .  the depression developed from a tropical disturbance well southeast of hawaii ,  which became much better organized on the night of august .  the tropical depression moved in a west northwest direction for the next hours and then changed to a west southwest track on august .  as it turned more to the southwest ,  the depression weakened until it dissipated on august about mi km south southeast of hilo ,  hawaii .  a tropical wave moved off the northwestern coast of africa into the atlantic ocean on august .  after moving across the atlantic and caribbean sea without development ,  the system moved through the intertropical convergence zone of the northeastern pacific ocean .  the cloudiness moved northward toward the gulf of tehuantepec on august .  the thunderstorm activity organized sufficiently for the system to be upgraded to tropical depression fifteen e on august while mi km southeast of acapulco ,  mexico .  the depression moved west northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm mi km south southwest of puerto vallarta on august .  the storm began to turn more westward due to a strengthening high pressure system to its north and was upgraded to a hurricane on august while mi km southwest of cabo san lucas .  as the high to the north continued to strengthen ,  the hurricane turned west southwest .  a weaker than normal high pressure system controlled the movement of the depression ,  and the system moved slowly to the west through its duration .  the depression strengthened into tropical storm marie on september ,  and into a hurricane on september ,  while mi km south southwest of clarion island .  marie reached its peak intensity of mph km h on september .  the hurricane crossed into the central north pacific on september as a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of mph km h .  the hurricane weakened thereafter and on september marie regained tropical storm status .  the system weakened into a tropical depression on september and dissipated as a tropical cyclone on september near the hawaiian coast .  no casualties or damages were caused by marie .  on september ,  norbert absorbed tropical depression eighteen e which was in close proximity .  norbert strengthened as it moved north northwestward .  the tropical storm was upgraded to a hurricane on september ,  and formed an eye on september .  the storm reached its peak strength of mph km h sustained winds that day .  turning north of due west ,  norbert then weakened as it moved over cooler waters .  it was downgraded to a tropical storm later on september ,  and then to a tropical depression on september .  norbert dissipated as a tropical cyclone on september after losing all its deep convection .  on september ,  satellite images indicated that the eighteenth tropical depression of the season formed southwest of cabo san lucas .  located in close proximity to tropical storm norbert ,  the depression would soon enter a region of colder sea surface temperatures ,  and the national hurricane center noted that only very little intensification was possible .  as predicted ,  norbert hindered further intensification of tropical depression eighteen e .  the national hurricane center noted six hours later that the depression would likely be absorbed into norbert .  the national hurricane center later believed that tropical depression eighteen e was dominating the interaction between the two systems ,  and was forecast to absorb norbert .  unlike the latter prediction ,  norbert absorbed tropical depression eighteen e later that day .  a tropical wave move off the coast of africa on september ,  and crossed the atlantic waters ,  the caribbean sea and eventually into the pacific ocean as a weak system .  an area of convection entered into the northeastern pacific ocean a few hundred miles south of acapulco ,  mexico .  on september ,  tropical depression nineteen e formed from this convection ,  while mi ,  km south southeast from the southern tip of baja california .  the depression moved on a west northwestward track ,  rounding the southwest side of a strong high pressure system .  the depression continued to strengthen and was upgraded to tropical storm odile on september and into a hurricane on september .  its intensity peaked with maximum sustained winds of mph km h on september .  the hurricane began to turn more northwestward in response to a high pressure system weakening to its north .  odile began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters on september .  the cyclone regained tropical storm status on september while it slowly progressed northward .  the system weakened into a tropical depression status on september .  once it lost its deep convection ,  odile was steered southwestward by the low level flow ,  before it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on october .  its remaining low level circulation of clouds continued on a southwestward course thereafter .  the highest rainfall total from the system in mexico totaled .  in mm at santa anita near the tip of baja california .  across northern mexico ,  thousands were homeless ,  and people died .  in texas ,  rachel s remnants caused heavy rain .  flooding occurred in the big bend area .  polo originated from a tropical wave that moved off the african coast on september which spawned hurricane isidore in the atlantic basin .  on september ,  the system increased in convection as it was moving to the west and approaching central america .  the southern extent of the wave crossed into the pacific ocean on september .  the wave continued westward and related thunderstorm activity increased during the following week .  the convective system organized into tropical depression twenty e on september nearly midway between mexico and hawaii .  initially ,  the depression drifted toward the northwest due to a large upper level trough located to its west .  polo strengthened rapidly into a hurricane early on september ,  with its winds peaking at mph km h .  since the storm was very small ,  vertical wind shear caused significant weakening thereafter .  on october ,  polo regained tropical storm strength as it was crossing into the north central pacific basin .  it dissipated as a tropical cyclone later that day .  there were no casualties or damages caused by polo .  except for socorro island ,  trudy had no impact on land .  the island reported hurricane force winds for seven hours .  trudy also had an unusually large eye ,  which was as large as mi km wide .  trudy is the fourth strongest pacific hurricane in october ,  behind kenna of the season ,  rick of the season ,  and patricia of the season .  trudy also spent hours of its life as a category hurricane ,  longer than any other hurricane in the eastern pacific basin .  the following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern pacific in .  no names were retired ,  so it was used again in the season .  this is the same list used for the season .  storms were named trudy and vance for the first time in .  names that were not assigned are marked in gray .  one name from the central pacific list was used aka .  it was the first usage for that name .  track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running ,  jumping ,  and throwing .  the name is derived from the sport s typical venue a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place .  track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics ,  which also includes road running ,  cross country running ,  and race walking .  it is one of the oldest sports .  in ancient times ,  it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the ancient olympic games in greece .  in modern times ,  the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are athletics competition at the olympic games and the iaaf world championships in athletics .  the international association of athletics federations is the international governing body .  records are kept of the best performances in specific events ,  at world and national levels ,  right down to a personal level .  however ,  if athletes are deemed to have violated the event s rules or regulations ,  they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased .  in north america ,  the term track and field may be used to refer to other athletics events ,  such as the marathon ,  rather than strictly track based events .  that same year ,  the international amateur athletic federation iaaf was established ,  becoming the international governing body for track and field ,  and it enshrined amateurism as one of its founding principles for the sport .  the national collegiate athletic association held their first men s outdoor track and field championship in ,  making it one of the most prestigious competitions for students ,  and this was soon followed by the introduction of track and field at the inaugural world student games in .  the first continental track and field competition was the south american championships ,  which was followed by the european athletics championships in .  note events in italics are competed at indoor world championships only beyond the short distances of sprinting events ,  factors such as an athlete s reactions and top speed becomes less important ,  while qualities such as pace ,  race tactics and endurance become more so .  there are three common long distance running events in track and field competitions metres ,  metres and ,  metres .  the latter two races are both olympic and world championship events outdoors ,  while the m is held at the iaaf world indoor championships .  the m and ,  m events have their historical roots in the mile and mile races .  the m was historically used as a women s long distance event ,  entering the world championship programme in and olympic programme in ,  but this was abandoned in favour of a women s m event in .  the iaaf keeps world records for five different types of track relays .  as with m and m events ,  all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances ,  with the less commonly contested distances being the m ,  m and m relays .  other events include the distance medley relay comprising legs of m ,  m ,  m ,  and m ,  which is frequently held in the united states ,  and a sprint relay ,  known as the swedish medley relay ,  which is popular in scandinavia and held at the world youth championships in athletics programme .  relay events have significant participation in the united states ,  where a number of large meetings or relay carnivals are focused almost exclusively on relay events .  by far the most common events are the metres hurdles for women ,  m hurdles for men and m hurdles for both sexes .  the men s m has been featured at every modern summer olympics while the men s m was introduced in the second edition of the games .  women s initially competed in the metres hurdles event ,  which entered the olympic programme in .  this was extended to the m hurdles at the olympics ,  but it was not until that a women s m hurdles event took place at the olympics having been introduced at the world championships in athletics the previous year .  outside of the hurdles events ,  the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles .  just as the hurdling events ,  the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in oxford ,  england .  however ,  this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing .  a steeplechase event was held on a track for the english championships and the summer olympics featured men s m and m steeplechase races .  the event was held over various distances until the summer olympics marked the rise of the metres steeplechase as the standard event .  the iaaf set the standards of the event in ,  and the event is held on a m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap .  despite the long history of men s steeplechase in track and field ,  the women s steeplechase only gained world championship status in ,  with its first olympic appearance coming in .  the men s triple jump competition has been ever present at the modern olympics ,  but it was not until that a women s version gained world championship status and went on to have its first olympic appearance three years later .  the men s standing triple jump event featured at the olympics in and ,  but such competitions have since become very uncommon ,  although it is still used as a non competitive exercise drill .  track and field contains some of the foremost kinds of throwing sports ,  and the four major disciplines are the only pure throwing events to feature at the olympic games .  all four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues .  the long and triple jump areas run alongside the central m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts .  the pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track .  shot put or weight throw is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions .  the throwing area is similar to the outdoor event ,  but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier .  in addition to hosting the world indoor championships ,  the iaaf has hosted the iaaf world indoor tour since .  the rules of track athletics or of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are set by the competition rules of the international association of athletics federations iaaf .  the most recent complete set of rules is the rules that relate only to competitions in .  key rules of track events are those regarding starting ,  running and finishing .  the start of a race is marked by a white line cm wide .  in all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved ,  so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish .  starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including m including the first leg of the m and m and may not be used for any other race .  no part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane .  for sprint races up to m ,  the starter gives two commands on your marks to instruct athletes to approach the start line ,  followed by set to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent .  the commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions ,  or in english or french in international competitions .  once all athletes are set in their starting position ,  the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated .  if the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed ,  the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over .  in general ,  most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually ,  under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition .  each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the longest distance .  men and women have different weights for their throwing implements men s javelin is grams compared to for women ,  men s weight throw is pounds compared to for women ,  men s discus is kilograms to women s ,  men s shot put is pounds compared to pounds for women ,  and men s hammer throw is also pounds to the women s .  additionally ,  men s high hurdles are at height of inches compared to women s hurdles which are inches .  for the intermediate hurdles meter hurdles ,  the men s hurdle height is inches compared to inches for women .  the international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations .  the international association of athletics federations is the global governing body for track and field ,  and athletics as a whole .  the governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies .  some national federations are named after the sport ,  including usa track field and the philippine amateur track field association ,  but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies .  these national federations regulate sub national and local track and field clubs ,  as well as other types of running clubs .  the major global track and field competitions are both held under the scope of athletics .  track and field contests make up the majority of events on the olympic and paralympic athletics programmes ,  which occur every four years .  track and field events have held a prominent position at the summer olympics since its inception in ,  and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the olympic and paralympic games .  events such as the metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any olympic or paralympic sporting event .  similar to the event programmes at the olympics ,  paralympics and world championships ,  track and field forms a significant part of continental championships .  the south american championships in athletics ,  created in ,  was the first continental championships and the european athletics championships became the second championships of this type in .  the asian athletics championships and african championships in athletics were created in the s and oceania started its championships in .  there are also indoor continental competitions in europe european athletics indoor championships and asia asian indoor athletics championships .  there has not been a consistent championships for all of north america ,  which may be in part due to the success of both the central american and caribbean championships and the usa outdoor track and field championships .  most countries have a national championship in track and field and ,  for athletes ,  these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions .  some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college level ,  which help develop younger athletes .  some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige ,  such as the ncaa track and field championship in the united states and the jamaican high school championships .  however ,  the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country .  one day track and field meetings form the most common and seasonal aspect of the sport they are the most basic level of track and field competition .  meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club ,  or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter .  in the case of the former ,  athletes are selected to represent their club or institution .  in the case of privately run or independent meetings ,  athletes participate on an invitation only basis .  the next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition .  for example ,  the olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the summer olympics .  all major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records .  other record types include stadium records ,  records by age range ,  records by disability ,  and records by institution or organisation .  cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records ,  as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions .  isabella mary beeton ne mayson march february ,  also known as mrs beeton ,  was an english journalist ,  editor and writer .  her name is particularly associated with her first book ,  the work mrs beeton s book of household management .  she was born in london and ,  after schooling in islington ,  north london ,  and heidelberg ,  germany ,  she married samuel orchart beeton ,  an ambitious publisher and magazine editor .  in september the beetons released a new ,  weekly publication called the queen ,  the ladies newspaper .  with the beetons busy running their other titles ,  they employed frederick greenwood as the editor .  isabella was buried at west norwood cemetery on february .  when the dictionary of every day cookery was published in the same year ,  samuel added a tribute to his wife at the end her works speak for themselves and ,  although taken from this world in the very height and strength ,  and in the early days of womanhood ,  she felt satisfaction so great to all who strive with good intent and warm will of knowing herself regarded with respect and gratitude .  according to nielsen media research ,  the episode was seen by .  million household viewers ,  an improvement over the previous week .  kaboom received generally positive reviews ,  with several commentators praising the series for resolving the long standing pit subplot .  the middle colonies comprised the middle region of the thirteen colonies of the british empire in north america .  much of the area was part of the new netherland until the british exerted their control over the region .  the english captured much of the area in its war with the dutch around ,  and the majority of the conquered land became the province of new york .  the duke of york and the king of england would later grant others ownership of the land which would become the province of new jersey and the province of pennsylvania .  the delaware colony later separated from pennsylvania ,  which was founded by william penn .  the provincial congress of new jersey ,  made up of elected delegates ,  formed in january to govern the colony .  the congress had royal governor william franklin arrested on june ,  declaring him an enemy to the liberties of this country .  on july ,  new jersey enacted the new jersey state constitution ,  soon after having empowered delegates to the continental congress ,  on june ,  to join in a declaration of independence .  the united states declaration of independence ended their colonial status .  in ,  the province of new jersey split from new york however ,  the new york new jersey line war continued until the final borders were decided in ,  and approved by the legislatures and the king in and respectively .  a colonial assembly convened in october ,  making new york the last colony to have an assembly .  a constitution was drafted and passed on october ,  giving the colonists many rights ,  including the rights to taxation without representation .  however ,  upon learning of the constitution ,  james ii declared it void .  the middle colonies political groups began as small groups with narrowly focused goals .  these coalitions eventually grew into diverse and large political organizations ,  evolving especially during the french and

families in oaxaca .  less than a week after olaf moved through southern mexico ,  hurricane pauline struck the same region with much stronger winds .  pauline caused heavier rainfall and more damage

land that is now the modern us state of minnesota from the louisiana purchase in ,  to its achieving statehood in .  the minnesota territory itself was formed only in but the area had a rich history well before this .  though there was a long history of european presence in the area before th century ,  it was during the th century that the united states began to establish a firm presence in what would become minnesota .  this era was a period of economic transition .  the dominant enterprise in the area since the th century had been the fur trade .  the dakota sioux ,  and later the ojibwe ,  tribes hunted and gathered pelts trading with french ,  british ,  and later american traders at grand portage ,  mendota ,  and other sites .  this trade gradually declined during the early th century as demand for furs in europe diminished .  the lumber industry grew rapidly ,  replacing furs as the key economic resource .  grain production began to develop late during this time as an emerging economic basis as well .  saw mills ,  and later grain mills ,  around fort snelling and saint anthony falls in east central minnesota became magnets for development .  by the end of the era east central minnesota had replaced northern minnesota as the economic center of the area .  this era was also as a period of cultural transition .  at the time the u . s .  took possession of the region ,  native americans were by far the largest ethnic groups .  their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the french ,  british ,  and americans asserted territorial claims on the area .  french and british traders had mixed with native society in the area for many decades peacefully contributing to the society and creating new ethnic groups consisting of mixed race peoples .  as the americans established outposts in the area and the fur trade declined ,  the dynamics changed dramatically .  the economic influence of the native americans diminished and american territorial ideology increasingly sought to limit their influence .  large waves of immigration in the s very suddenly changed the demographics so that within a few years the population shifted from predominantly native to predominantly people of european descent .  the native and mixed race populations continued to influence the territory s culture and politics ,  even at the end of the territorial era ,  though by the time statehood was achieved that influence was in steep decline .  heavy immigration from new england and new york led to minnesota s being labeled the new england of the west .  though the various parts of what is now minnesota were claimed at different times by spain ,  france ,  and britain ,  none of these nations made significant efforts to establish major settlements in the area .  instead the french and the british established mostly trading posts and utilized the natives in the area as suppliers .  most of the remaining areas of what is now the state were purchased in from france as part of the louisiana purchase the area west of the mississippi having been recently acquired by france from spain .  parts of northern minnesota were considered to be in rupert s land ,  a large territory owned by hudson s bay company .  the exact definition of the boundary between minnesota and british north america was not addressed until the anglo american convention of .  at the beginning of the th century many parts of the minnesota area were already well traveled by british and french explorers .  though the region s population was mostly native american ,  there were important british trading posts in the area with many european and mixed race settlers ,  particularly in the north .  grand portage ,  in particular ,  had long been established as the major trading center for the north west company .  david thompson ,  a british fur trader for the north west company of montreal ,  completed numerous surveys and maps of the north american frontier .  in he completed the first known map of the minnesota area ,  in what was then the northwest territory .  the jay treaty ,  however ,  obliged most of the british settlers to withdraw their settlements in ,  though mixed race peoples remained .  in the th parallel was established as the boundary between the united states and british north america .  however ,  the point where the red river crossed this line was not marked until ,  when stephen long conducted a survey expedition .  the expedition determined ,  among other things ,  that the fur trading post of pembina lay just inside the u . s .  border .  in addition to these military bases ,  private companies operated numerous trading posts in the region that were often referred to as forts ,  though they typically had little in the way of defensive fortifications .  from to employees of the hudson s bay company and the north west company engaged in various territorial conflicts known as the fur trade wars ,  including the famous battle of seven oaks at what is now winnipeg ,  manitoba .  as a result of these conflicts numerous mtis migrated from the red river area to central and eastern minnesota ,  particularly in the vicinity of saint paul .  this red river exodus became a major source of francophone immigration into minnesota during the territorial era .  the mtis and other mixed race groups were often regarded as french canadian whites rather than indians .  the most important commercial enterprise in the early part of the territorial era was the lucrative fur trade .  at the beginning of the th century two british companies competed for dominance in the north american trade hudson s bay company and the north west company .  the north west company had used grand portage as its western headquarters along with other smaller companies that operated in the area .  grand portage was one of the four principal british trading and shipping points furs in north america .  following the treaty of paris ,  in ,  british operations at grand portage were technically illegal though the trade continued .  however ,  beginning in the north west company began re establishing its headquarters north of the border at the newly constructed fort william in what is now ontario .  after grand portage had been reduced to a minor trading center and most traders eventually abandoned the area .  in ,  the hudson bay company ,  which had by then absorbed the north west company ,  shipped out a final band of ojibwe who were employed by the company .  one of the major sources of income in the territory during the s was u . s .  government annuity payments to the ojibwe and other tribes required by earlier treaties .  these payments amounted to more than ,  per year on average .  million in present day terms compared to approximately ,  per year .  million in present day terms given to the territory itself for development .  because of corruption ,  and mishandling of the payments to the tribes ,  a great deal of the money was used directly by u . s .  settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes .  at the beginning of the minnesota territory ,  in fact ,  these payments were the territory s most important source of income since the fur trade was no longer as lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible .  construction on fort snelling began in and was finished in .  the fort became a magnet for settlement in east central minnesota .  nearby mendota was established during the same period and ,  as the regional headquarters for the american fur company ,  also drew settlement in the area soon becoming minnesota s commercial center .  many of the first stone buildings in the territory were constructed in mendota by employees of the american fur company ,  which bought animal pelts at that location from to .  by ,  treaties between native american tribes and the u . s .  government had opened much of minnesota to u . s .  settlement .  fort snelling was no longer a frontier outpost .  efforts to establish minnesota as a prominent future state in the union were swift .  in territorial legislature petitioned the u . s .  congress for land to build a railroad between milwaukee ,  wisconsin and saint paul .  that same year the legislature incorporated the university of minnesota and established its endowment though the university would not admit students until many years later .  the influx of settlers in the s transformed minnesota from a sparsely populated territory of less than ,  white settlers and a significantly larger native population ,  to a substantial population center of over ,  predominantly european settlers .  the city of saint paul expanded from less than people in to over in and over ,  in .  until the s the native american population vastly outnumbered the population of european ancestry in the area .  nevertheless ,  the division between indian and white during this era was always somewhat vague .  in general persons of mixed descent were considered white if they dressed in european clothing and adopted european customs .  indians were those who lived in traditional native lifestyles .  even as the u . s .  began to establish its authority over the region and some settlers from the u . s .  began to arrive the native american population continued to hold significant political and social influence as a result of the fur trade .  as experienced hunters they were important to one of north america s major business enterprises .  the decline of this trade during the later part of the era marked the decline of native american influence .  it is in fact likely that a very large percentage of the white population reported in the census was of partially native american ancestry .  many men of mixed racial ancestry became respected members of white society .  william w .  warren ,  for example ,  was the son of an american entrepreneur who hailed from new york before he began working in john jacob astor s american fur company and a mixed blood ojibwe mother whose father had been in the old french and british fur trade was educated in the east and in the early s lived on the upper mississippi ,  in part working as an independent translator and indian agency contractor .  warren was a good writer his newspaper articles were eventually published as the only th century compendium of ojibwe history and was elected to the territorial legislature before his death from consumption .  the ordinance was nevertheless seen as ambiguous in that it did not specifically address the slaves already in the territories ,  and it discussed the free population of the territories seemingly implying that a slave population would exist .  french traders in the territories ,  and later even american army officers including josiah snelling who commanded his namesake fort ,  continued to hold slaves with the blessings of many in congress .  throughout the first half of the th century ,  the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the northwest territory ,  formed in .  after ohio s statehood the area became part of the new illinois territory in .  after illinois statehood the area was incorporated into the michigan territory in and later became part of the wisconsin territory in .  the western and southern areas of the state were not formally organized until ,  when they became part of the iowa territory .  stephen a .  douglas d ,  the chair of the united states senate committee on territories ,  drafted the bill authorizing the minnesota territory in .  he had envisioned a future for the upper mississippi valley ,  so he was motivated to keep the area from being carved up by neighboring territories .  in ,  he had prevented iowa from including fort snelling and saint anthony falls within its northern border .  in ,  he kept the organizers of wisconsin from including saint paul and saint anthony falls .  the minnesota territory was established from the lands remaining from iowa territory and wisconsin territory on march ,  .  the minnesota territory extended far into what is now north dakota and south dakota ,  to the missouri river .  there was a dispute over the shape of the state to be carved out of minnesota territory .  an alternate proposal that was only narrowly defeated would have made the th parallel the state s northern border and the missouri river its western border ,  thus giving up the whole northern half of the state in exchange for the eastern half of what later became south dakota .  alexander ramsey w became the first governor of minnesota territory and henry hastings sibley d became the territorial delegate to the united states congress .  henry m .  rice d ,  who replaced sibley as the territorial delegate in ,  worked in congress to promote minnesota interests .  he lobbied for the construction of a railroad connecting saint paul and lake superior ,  with a link from saint paul to the illinois central railroad .  in december ,  rice brought forward two bills in congress an enabling act that would allow minnesota to form a state constitution ,  and a railroad land grant bill .  the enabling act defined a state containing both prairie and forest lands with the boundaries drawn as they are today .  the bid for statehood came at a time when north south tensions in the u . s .  were rising ,  tensions that would later lead to the american civil war .  debate over admitting minnesota as a free state was heated ,  but the enabling act was finally passed on february ,  .  maeda was fundamental to the development of brazilian jiu jitsu ,  including through his teaching of carlos gracie and others of the gracie family .  he was also a promoter of japanese emigration to brazil .  maeda won more than ,  professional fights in his career .  his accomplishments led to him being called the toughest man who ever lived and being referred to as the father of brazilian jiu jitsu .  tomita ,  maeda ,  and satake sailed from yokohama on november ,  and arrived in new york city on december ,  .  in any event ,  later that year the us military academy hired a former world champion professional wrestler ,  tom jenkins ,  instead of a judo teacher ,  a job jenkins kept until his retirement in .  maeda was fond of the name and started using it to promote his art thereafter .  many etymological suggestions have been made ,  though there is no general agreement you may be a fox ,  ono called after her

after the webber avenue intersection ,  ny turns to the northeast ,  where it passes the athletic fields of sleepy hollow high school .  ny intersects with sleepy hollow road ,  which leads into a residential development and parallels ny northeastward for a short distance .  a request by the state to dismiss the suit was denied in august ,  and the case was eventually heard by the state court of appeals ,  the highest court in the state .  in the meantime ,  the state built the easternmost mile .  km of the new alignment ,  which was not affected by the lawsuit .  on july ,  the court ruled in favor of the sleepy hollow valley committee .  as a result ,  the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north ,  bypassing north tarrytown completely .  the new alignment of ny was completed in the early s ,  and its former alignment along bedford road was redesignated as ny .  the entire route is in westchester county .  hurricane tanya was the final storm of the very active atlantic hurricane season .  the twenty first tropical cyclone ,  nineteenth named storm ,  and eleventh hurricane of the season ,  tanya developed from a tropical wave while well north of the lesser antilles on october .  the system headed northeastward and strengthened into tropical storm tanya on october .  tanya meandered around the central atlantic ,  and further intensified into a hurricane on october .  thereafter ,  tanya tracked northeastward before curving to the east northeast .  after switching to an eastward direction ,  tanya weakened to a tropical storm on november .  later that day ,  tanya passed through the azores as it was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone .  throughout the azores ,  the extratropical remnants of tanya produced

ground during the day and moves around its territories at night .  young birds indulge in play fighting ,  and one bird will often lock the neck of another under its chin .  the kakapo is curious by nature and has been known to interact with humans .  conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kakapo ,  which have distinct personalities .  the kakapo is the only species of flightless parrot in the world ,  and the only flightless bird that has a lek breeding system .  males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females .  females listen to the males as they display ,  or lek .  they choose a mate based on the quality of his display they are not pursued by the males in any overt way .  no pair bond is formed males and females meet only to mate .  females are attracted by the booms of the competing males they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena .  once a female enters the court of one of the males ,  the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak .  he turns his back to the female ,  spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her .  he will then attempt copulation for to minutes .  once the birds have mated ,  the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks .  the male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female .  beginning in the s ,  european settlers cleared vast tracts of land for farming and grazing ,  further reducing kakapo habitat .  they brought more dogs and other mammalian predators ,  including domestic cats ,  black rats and stoats .  europeans knew little of the kakapo until george gray of the british museum described it from a skin in .  as the mori had done ,  early european explorers and their dogs ate kakapo .  in the late th century ,  the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity ,  and thousands were captured or killed for zoos ,  museums and collectors .  most captured specimens died within months .  from at least the s ,  collectors knew the kakapo population was declining their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct .  in ,  the kakapo recovery programme presented a new management plan that would run from to .  the key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least by ,  increase genetic diversity ,  maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population ,  and maintain public awareness and support .  during the summer breeding season ,  the total population of kakapo rose to over for the first time since monitoring began ,  reaching by february .  twenty two of the chicks had to be hand reared because of a shortage of food on codfish island .  in ,  seven kakapo were transferred to little barrier island ,  in an attempt to establish a successful breeding programme .  kakapo were last on the island in .  despite this ,  the kakapo was also regarded as an affectionate pet by the mori .  this was corroborated by european settlers in new zealand in the th century ,  among them george edward grey ,  who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet kakapo s behaviour towards him and his friends was more like that of a dog than a bird .  live kicking is a bbc

documented native hawaiian and hawaii born combatants who fought in the american civil war while the kingdom of hawaii was still an independent nation .  for a period of time after the end of the war ,  the legacy and contributions of pitman and other documented hawaiian participants in the american civil war were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians .  however ,  there has been a revival of interest in recent years in the hawaiian community .  in ,  these hawaii sons of the civil war were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the national memorial cemetery of the pacific in honolulu .  growing into adolescence ,  he was said to strongly resemble his hawaiian mother .  robert g .  carter gave a brief description of his appearance in wartime letters first published in considering him missing ,  pitman s regiment did not discover his final fate until news of his funeral at roxbury was received in the spring of

the following awards a topological ordering of a directed graph is an ordering of its vertices into a sequence ,  such that for every edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge .  a graph that has a topological ordering cannot have any cycles ,  because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle would have to be oriented the wrong way .  therefore ,  every graph with a topological ordering is acyclic .  conversely ,  every directed acyclic graph has a topological ordering .  therefore ,  this property can be used as an alternative definition of the directed acyclic graphs they are exactly the graphs that have topological orderings .  the transitive reduction of a dag g is the graph with the fewest edges that represents the same reachability relation as g .  it is a subgraph of g ,  formed by discarding the edges u v for which g also contains a longer path connecting the same two vertices .  like the transitive closure ,  the transitive reduction is uniquely defined for dags .  in contrast ,  for a directed graph that is not acyclic ,  there can be more than one minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation .  every directed acyclic graph has a topological ordering ,  an ordering of the vertices such that the starting endpoint of every edge occurs earlier in the ordering than the ending endpoint of the edge .  the existence of such an ordering can be used to characterize dags a directed graph is a dag if and only if it has a topological ordering .  in general ,  this ordering is not unique a dag has a unique topological ordering if and only if it has a directed path containing all the vertices ,  in which case the ordering is the same as the order in which the vertices appear in the path .  the family of topological orderings of a dag is the same as the family of linear extensions of the reachability relation for the dag ,  so any two graphs representing the same partial order have the same set of topological orders .  these numbers may be computed by the recurrence relation a directed acyclic graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements .  in this representation ,  data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges .  the episode first aired on november ,  in the united states to mostly positive reviews

not made an appearance in the competition .  his three month deal at blackburn expired on december ,  and after not being offered a new contract was released by the club ,  he entered talks with new australian a league club north queensland fury .  shortly after his arrival in australia ,  it was reported in the british media that fowler would be making a swift return to his homeland and sign for league one side tranmere rovers ,  who had just appointed fowler s former liverpool team mate john barnes as manager .  however ,  fowler was quick to dismiss talk of a quick return to england .  when barnes was dismissed three months later ,  it was reported that tranmere had approached fowler about becoming player manager ,  but these reports too were dismissed .  on june ,  fowler played in his first competitive game for england in nearly three years ,  starting in the draw with bulgaria during euro qualifying .  kevin keegan named fowler in the preliminary squad for euro ,  and after

league player of the month december ,  january the poem is an example of keats s break from the structure of the classical form .  it follows the poet s contemplation of a morning spent in idleness .  three figures are presented ambition ,  love and poesy dressed in placid sandals and white robes .  the narrator examines each using a series of questions and statements on life and art .  the poem concludes with the narrator giving up on having all three of the figures as part of his life .  some critics regard ode on indolence as inferior to the other four odes .  others suggest that the poem exemplifies a continuity of themes and imagery characteristic of his more widely read works ,  and provides valuable biographical insight into his poetic career .  the poem relies on a first person narration style similar to ode to psyche .  it begins with a classical scene from an urn in a similar manner to ode on a grecian urn ,  but the scene in indolence is allegorical .  the opening describes three figures that operate as three fates with bowed necks ,  and joined hands ,  side faced in placid sandals ,  and in white robes graced they pass d ,  like figures on a marble urn when shifted round to see the other side they came again ,  as ,  when the urn once more is shifted round ,  the first seen shades return the figures remain mysterious as they circle around the narrator .  eventually they turn towards him and it is revealed that they are ambition ,  love ,  and poesy ,  the themes of the poem a third time pass d they by ,  and ,  passing ,  turn d then faded ,  and to follow them i burn d the first was a fair maid ,  and love her name the second was ambition ,  pale of cheek ,  the last ,  whom i love more ,  the more of blame i knew to be my demon poesy .  lines and for that poor ambition it springs from a man s little heart s short fever fit for poesy ,  no ,  she has not a joy ,  o ,  for an age so shelter d from annoy ,  that i may never know how change the moons ,  or hear the voice of busy common sense ,  lines a pet lamb in a sentimental farce ,  and for the day faint visions there is store into the clouds ,  and never more return ,  lines the classical influences keats invoked affected other romantic poets ,  but his odes contain a higher degree of allusion than most of his contemporaries works .  as for the main theme ,  indolence and poetry ,  the poem reflects the emotional state of being keats describes in an early letter to his brother george erving goffman june november was a canadian american sociologist and writer ,  considered the most influential american sociologist of the twentieth century .  in he was listed by the times higher education guide as the sixth most cited author in the humanities and social sciences ,  behind anthony giddens and ahead of jrgen habermas .  goffman is sometimes credited with having in coined the term total institution ,  though fine and manning note that he had heard it in lectures by everett hughes in reference to any type of institution in which people are treated alike and in which behavior is regulated .  regardless of whether goffman coined the term total institution ,  he popularized it with his book ,  asylums essays on the social situation of mental patients and other inmates .  the book has been described as ethnography of the concept of the total institution .  the book was one of the first sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients in psychiatric hospitals and a major contribution to understanding of social aspects of mental illness .  frame analysis an essay on the organization of experience is goffman s attempt to explain how conceptual frames ways to organize experience structure an individual s perception of society .  this book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society .  a frame is a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals ,  groups and societies .  frame analysis ,  then ,  is the study of the organization of social experience .  to illustrate the concept of the frame ,  goffman gives the example of a picture frame a person uses the frame which represents structure to hold together his picture which represents the content of what he is experiencing in his life .  goffman saw this book as his magnum opus ,  but it was not as popular as his earlier works .  the frame analyses of talk gender advertisements is a book that ,  as part of goffman s series of studies in the anthropology of visual communication ,  deals with the topic of gender representation in advertising .  the book is a visual essay about sex roles in advertising ,  differences in the depictions of men and women and the subtle ,  underlying messages about the sexual roles projected by masculine and feminine images in advertising ,  as well as and symbolism in advertising .  in the book goffman examined over advertisements in order to find general patterns in stereotypical gender representation ,  which he placed into six categories relative size goffman argues that social situation is expressed through the relative size of the persons in the advertisements ,  with men showing their superiority through their girth and height .  the family when families are depicted in advertising ,  parents are shown to be closer to their children of the same gender and in some instances men are shown separate from the rest of the family ,  in a protective manner .  in his career ,  goffman worked at the university of chicago ,  division of social sciences ,  chicago assistant ,  resident associate ,  national institute of mental health ,  bethesda ,  maryland visiting scientist ,  university of california ,  berkeley assistant professor ,  professor ,  professor of sociology ,  university of pennsylvania ,  philadelphia benjamin franklin professor of anthropology and sociology

kelly rowland and michelle williams audio mastering tom coyne guitarist tim stewart marshall herff applewhite ,  jr .  may ,  march ,  also known as bo and do ,  among other names ,  was an american cult leader who founded what became known as the heaven s gate religious group and organized their mass suicide in claiming the lives of thirty nine people .  a native of texas ,  applewhite attended several universities and ,  as a young man ,  served in the united states army .  after finishing school at austin college ,  he taught music at the university of alabama .  he later returned to texas ,  where he led choruses and served as the chair of the music department at the university of st .  thomas in houston .  he left the school in ,  citing emotional turmoil .  his father s death a year later brought on severe depression .  in ,  he developed a close friendship with bonnie nettles ,  a nurse together ,  they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers .  they operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while ,  and then began to travel around the u . s .  in to spread their views .  they only gained one convert .  in ,  applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months .  in jail ,  he further developed his theology .  marshall herff applewhite was born in spur ,  texas ,  on may ,  to marshall herff applewhite sr .  and his wife louise ne winfield he had three siblings .  the son of a presbyterian minister ,  applewhite became very religious as a child .  applewhite moved to new york city in an unsuccessful attempt to launch a professional singing career upon finishing his education in colorado .  he then taught at the university of alabama .  he lost his position there after pursuing a sexual relationship with a male student his religious education was likely not supportive of same sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires .  he separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in ,  and they divorced three years later .  applewhite believed in the ancient astronaut hypothesis ,  which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and placed humans on earth and would return to collect a select few .  parts of this teaching bear similarities to the reformed christian concept of election ,  likely owing to applewhite s presbyterian upbringing .  he often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from star trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show .  applewhite and nettles sometimes made sudden ,  drastic changes to the group .  on one occasion in texas ,  they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night ,  at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test .  lalich sees this as a way that they increased their students devotion ,  ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw .  members became desperate for applewhite s approval ,  which he used to control them .  applewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy ,  teaching that his students needed his guidance ,  as he needed the guidance of the next level .  zeller notes that this naturally ensured that there would be no possibility of the group s continuing if applewhite were to die .  a relationship with applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation he encouraged his followers to see him as christ .  zeller states that the group s previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on applewhite s role as a mediator .  applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings ,  but ,  in the s ,  the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority .  while covering the suicides ,  several media outlets focused on applewhite s sexuality the new york post dubbed him the gay guru .  gay rights activist troy perry argued that applewhite s repression ,  and society s rejection ,  of same sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide .  this idea has failed to gain support among academics .  zeller argues that applewhite s sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism ,  which he believes resulted from a variety of factors ,  though he grants sexuality a role .  as the war

founder jenova chen was the creative director and nick clark returned as lead designer .  kellee santiago ,  producer of flow and flower ,  did not reprise her duties ,  concentrating instead on her role as the company s president ,  and was replaced by robin hunicke .  the stress of the project led to the feeling there was not enough time or money to complete everything the team wished to ,  which added to the stress and caused arguments about the design of the game .  the developers ended up reducing the overtime they spent on the project to avoid burning out ,  though it meant further

to shorten the song ,  and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much ,  saying ,  these fucking guys ,  they re supposed to be so spiritual they don t spot a miracle when it hits them in the face .  nothing like that ever happened to me in the studio in my whole life .  the band s original concept for no line on the horizon was to create an album of future hymns songs

was just playing a supporting role and that the episode ,  essentially the middle episode of a three episode arc ,  was just a transitional episode to get us to amor fati ,  which was really less

crickets are non native ,  they are considered pests ,  and various biological controls have been used .  gryllotalpa species have been used as food in west java ,  vietnam ,  and the philippines .  within these subfamilies ,  genera include gryllotalpa neocurtilla scapteriscus neoscapteriscus adults of most species of mole cricket can fly powerfully ,  if not with agility ,  but males do so infrequently .  the females typically take wing soon after sunset ,  and are attracted to areas where males are calling ,  which they do for about an hour after sunset .  this may be in order to mate ,  or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg laying ,  as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity .  mole crickets live almost entirely below ground ,  digging tunnels of different kinds for the major functions of life ,  including feeding ,  escape from predators ,  attracting a mate by singing ,  mating ,  and raising of young .  males attract mates by constructing specially shaped tunnels in which they sing .  mating takes place in the male s burrow the male may widen a tunnel to make room for the female to mount ,  though in some species mating is tail to tail .  females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially dug brood chambers which are sealed when complete in the case of the genus neoscapteriscus or not sealed in the case of genera gryllotalpa and neocurtilla .  mole crickets are relatively common ,  but because they are nocturnal and spend nearly all their lives underground in extensive tunnel systems ,  they are rarely seen .  they inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas .  they are present in every continent with the exception of antarctica by ,  one hundred and seven species had

and the four merchants discussed the revolution ,  subsequent rebellions ,  and their consequences .  speaking as a pro republican ,  napoleon supported the jacobin cause ,  and explained the benefits of the revolution ,  whilst defending carteaux s actions in avignon .  one of the merchants from marseille expressed his moderate views regarding the revolution ,  and reasons for supporting civil war against a central government .  the merchant stressed that marseille did not fight for the royalist cause ,  but opposed the nature of the convention itself ,  condemning its decrees and deeming the execution of citizens as unlawful .  napoleon concluded that the people of marseille should reject counter revolutionary ideals and adopt the constitution of the french republic in order to end the civil war and allow the regular army to restore france .  shortly after the events ,  possibly on the july whilst still in beaucaire ,  napoleon wrote a political pamphlet titled le souper de

,  the huai river ,  north of the yangtze ,  was designated as the boundary between the two empires .  the song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of ,  taels of silver and ,  packs of silk to the jin .  the treaty reduced the southern song s status to that of a jin vassal .  the document designated the song as the insignificant state ,  while the jin was recognized as the superior state .  the text of the treaty has not survived in chinese records ,  a sign of its humiliating reputation .  the contents of the agreement were recovered from a jurchen biography .  once the treaty had been settled ,  the jurchens retreated north and trade resumed between the two empires .  the peace ensured by the shaoxing treaty lasted for the next seventy years ,  but was interrupted twice .  one campaign was initiated by the song and the other by the jin .  the t howitzer motor carriage hmc was a united states army self propelled gun used in world war ii .  its design was based on requirements for an

selected it the greatest song of all time on the nine network s to countdown show on september .  they voted it eleventh in the youth radio network triple j s hottest of all time on july .  authors ben urish and ken bielen criticised the song s instrumental music as overly sentimental and melodramatic ,  comparing it to the music of the pre rock era and describing the vocal melody as understated .  according to blaney ,  lennon s lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities that offer no practical solutions lyrics that are at times nebulous and contradictory ,  asking the listener to abandon political systems while encouraging one similar to communism .  author chris ingham indicated the hypocrisy in lennon ,  the millionaire rock star living in a mansion ,  encouraging listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions .  others argue that lennon intended the song s lyrics to inspire listeners to imagine if the world could live without possessions ,  not as an explicit call to give them up .  blaney commented lennon knew he had nothing concrete to offer ,  so instead he offers a dream ,  a concept to be built upon .  in december ,  lennon and ono appeared at the apollo theater in harlem .  lennon performed imagine with an acoustic guitar ,  yielding the earliest known live recording of the song ,  later included on the john lennon anthology .  in ,  he sang imagine during his final public performance ,  a birthday celebration for lew grade .  the song was performed as part of the closing ceremony of the summer olympics .  performed by the liverpool philharmonic youth choir and the liverpool signing choir ,  the choirs sang the first verse and accompanied lennon s original vocals during the rest of the song .  a cover performed by emeli sand was also used by the bbc for a closing montage that ended its coverage .  imagine subsequently re entered the uk top ,  reaching number .  in ,  american singer songwriter lady gaga performed the song at the european games opening ceremony .  the song was played for ,  people in baku ,  azerbaijan that served as host of the event .  john lennon vocals ,  piano alan white drums the jackson would release a second single with steeltown records before moving to motown records .  the group s recordings at steeltown records were thought to be lost ,  but they were rediscovered more than years later .  they were remastered and released in ,  with big boy as the promotional lead single .  the jackson five would release a second and final single through steeltown records we don t have to be over to fall in love .  the two singles were to be supported by an eleven track studio album but it was never released .  on july ,  the group signed a contract with motown records .  however ,  as the group s steeltown contract had not yet expired ,  the new contract could not be fully executed until march ,  .  motown records tried to get the group out of their steeltown contract ,  and ultimately succeeded with a financial settlement .  it is estimated that to million people ,  mostly in mexico ,  central america and south america ,  have chagas disease as of .  in ,  chagas was estimated to result in ,  deaths per year .  most people with the disease are poor ,  and most people with the disease do not realize they are infected .  large scale population movements have increased the areas where chagas disease is found and these include many european countries and the united states .  these areas have also seen an increase in the years up to .  the disease was first described in by carlos chagas after whom it is named .  it affects more than other animals .  the human disease occurs in two stages an acute stage ,  which occurs shortly after an initial infection ,  and a chronic stage that develops over many years .  in argentina ,  the disease is known as mal de chagas mazza ,  in honor of salvador mazza ,  the argentine physician who in began investigating the disease and over the years became the principal researcher of this disease in the country .  mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of trypanosoma cruzi in argentina in ,  eventually leading to support from local and european medical schools and argentine government policy makers .  calvert had a total of thirteen children cecil ,  who succeeded his father as the nd baron baltimore ,  leonard ,  anne ,  mary ,  dorothy ,  elizabeth ,  grace ,  francis ,  george ,  helen ,  henry ,  john ,  and philip .  no disgrace was attached to calvert s departure from office the king ,  to whom he had always remained personally loyal ,  confirmed his place on the privy council and appointed him baron baltimore ,  in county longford in leinster of central ireland .  immediately after calvert resigned ,  he converted to roman catholicism .  the settlement appeared to be progressing so well that in january ,  calvert obtained a concession from king james for the whole of newfoundland ,  though the grant was soon reduced to cover only the southeastern avalon peninsula ,  owing to competing claims from other english colonists .  the final charter constituted the province as a county palatinate ,  officially titled the province of avalon ,  under calvert s personal rule .  in ,  he sailed again for newfoundland ,  this time with his second wife jane ,  most of his children ,  and more settlers ,  to officially take over as proprietary governor of avalon .  he and his family moved into the house at ferryland built by wynne ,  a sizeable structure for the time ,  by colonial standards ,  and the only one in the settlement large enough to accommodate religious services for the community .  baltimore sent his children home to england in august .  by the time the king s letter reached avalon ,  he had departed with his wife and servants for virginia .  his health declining ,  baltimore s persistence over the charter finally paid off in .  the king first granted him a location south of jamestown ,  but baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of carolina into a sugar plantation .  baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries to the north of the potomac river ,  on either side of the chesapeake bay .  the charter was about to pass when the fifty two year old baltimore died in his lodgings at lincoln s inn fields ,  on april .  five weeks later ,  on june ,  the charter for maryland passed the seals .  years after its first settlement ,  maryland joined twelve other british colonies along the atlantic coast in declaring their independence from british rule and the right to freedom of religion for all citizens in the new united states .  a pattern of political and financial motivation ,  and a lack of understanding of the geography and ecology of the everglades have plagued the history of drainage projects .  the everglades are a part of a massive watershed that originates near orlando and drains into lake okeechobee ,  a vast and shallow lake .  as the lake exceeds its capacity in the wet season ,  the water forms a flat and very wide river ,  about miles km long and miles km wide .  as the land from lake okeechobee slopes gradually to florida bay ,  water flows at a rate of half a mile .  km a day .  before human activity in the everglades ,  the system comprised the lower third of the florida peninsula .  the first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer hamilton disston in .  disston s sponsored canals were unsuccessful ,  but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer henry flagler .  flagler built a railroad along the east coast of florida and eventually to key west towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line .  during his campaign to be elected governor ,  napoleon bonaparte broward promised to drain the everglades ,  and his later projects were more effective than disston s .  broward s promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer s report ,  pressure from real estate developers ,  and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south florida .  the increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds hunted for their plumes ,  alligators ,  and other everglades animals .  severe hurricanes in and caused catastrophic damage and flooding from lake okeechobee that prompted the army corps of engineers to build a dike around the lake .  further floods in prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern florida .  following another population boom after world war ii ,  and the creation of the central and southern florida flood control project ,  the everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas .  however ,  in the late s ,  following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to everglades national park ,  national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the everglades .  as early as ,  a visitor to the everglades suggested the value of the land without the water nevertheless ,  smith returned a report to the secretary of the treasury asking for ,  to do the job .  the report is the first published study on the topic of the everglades ,  and concluded with the statement smith suggested cutting through the rim of the everglades known today as the atlantic coastal ridge ,  connecting the heads of rivers to the coastline so that feet .  m of water would be drained from the area .  the result ,  smith hoped ,  would yield farmland suitable for corn ,  sugar ,  rice ,  cotton ,  and tobacco .  disston s engineers focused on lake okeechobee as well .  as one colleague put it ,  okeechobee is the point to attack the canals were to be equal or greater than the inflow from the kissimmee valley ,  which is the source of all the evil .  disston sponsored the digging of a canal miles km long from lake okeechobee towards miami ,  but it was abandoned when the rock proved denser than the engineers had expected .  though the canals lowered the groundwater ,  their capacity was inadequate for the wet season .  a report that evaluated the failure of the project concluded the reduction of the waters is simply a question of sufficient capacity in the canals which may be dug for their relief .  the focus of government agencies quickly shifted to the control of floods rather than drainage .  the okeechobee flood control district ,  financed by both state and federal funds ,  was created in .  president herbert hoover toured the towns affected by the okeechobee hurricane and ,  an engineer himself ,  ordered the army corps of engineers to assist the communities surrounding the lake .  between and ,  a dike miles km long was built around the southern edge of the lake ,  and a shorter one around the northern edge .  it was feet m tall and .  feet .  m thick on the lake side ,  feet .  m thick on the top ,  and feet .  m thick toward land .  control of the hoover dike and the waters of lake okeechobee were delegated to federal powers the united states declared legal limits of the lake to be feet .  m and feet .  m .  dumont laboratories was founded in by dr .  allen b .  dumont with only ,  and a laboratory in his basement .  he and his staff were responsible for many early technical innovations ,  including the first consumer all electronic television set in .  the company s television sets soon became the gold standard of the industry .  in ,  dumont worked with the army in developing radar technology during world war ii .  this ended up bringing in million in capital for the company .  ted mack s the original amateur hour ,  which began on radio in the s under original host edward bowes the morey amsterdam show ,  a comedy variety show hosted by morey amsterdam ,  which started on cbs before moving to dumont in captain video and his video rangers ,  a hugely popular kids science fiction series the arthur murray party ,  a dance program down you go ,  a popular panel show live coverage of boxing and professional wrestling ,  the latter featuring matches staged by the capitol wrestling corporation ,  the predecessor to wwe the johns hopkins science review ,  a peabody award winning education program cash and carry ,  the first network televised game show the ernie kovacs show ,  the first truly innovative show in what was then visual radio ,  not television .  although dumont s programming pre dated videotape ,  many dumont offerings were recorded on kinescopes .  these kinescopes were said to be stored in a warehouse until the s .  actress edie adams ,  the wife of comedian ernie kovacs both regular performers on early television testified in before a panel of the library of congress on the preservation of television and video .  adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into upper new york bay .  nevertheless ,  a number of dumont programs survive at the paley center for media in new york city ,  the ucla film and television archive in los angeles ,  in the peabody awards collection at the university of georgia ,  and the museum of broadcast communications in chicago .  dumont programs were by necessity low budget affairs ,  and the network received relatively few awards from the tv industry .  most awards during the s went to nbc and cbs ,  who were able to out spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the relatively new television medium .  dumont ,  however ,  did win a number of awards during its years of operation .  the johns hopkins science review ,  a dumont public affairs program ,  was awarded a peabody award in in the education category .  sheen s emmy and the science review peabody were the only national awards the dumont network received .  though dumont series and performers continued to win local tv awards ,  by the mid s the dumont network no longer had a national presence .  the earliest measurements of tv audiences were performed by the c .  e .  hooper company of new york .  dumont performed well in the hooper ratings in fact ,  dumont s talent program ,  the original amateur hour ,  was the most popular series of the season .  variety ranked dumont s popular variety series cavalcade of stars as the tenth most popular series two seasons later .  by this time ,  dumont had begun to differentiate itself from nbc and cbs .  it allowed its advertisers to choose the locations where their advertising ran ,  potentially saving them millions of dollars .  by contrast ,  abc operated like cbs and nbc even though it was only a fourth as large ,  forcing advertisers to purchase a large must buy list of stations .  abc s fortunes were dramatically altered in february ,  when the fcc cleared the way for upt to buy the network .  the merger provided abc with a badly needed cash infusion ,  giving it the resources to mount top shelf programming and to provide a national television service on a scale approaching that of cbs and nbc .  through upt president leonard goldenson ,  abc also gained ties with the hollywood studios that more than matched those dumont s producers had with broadway .  for years ,  dumont was the only major broadcast television network to cease operations ,  until cbs corporation and time warner shut down two other struggling networks ,  upn and the wb ,  in september to create the cw television network whose schedule was originally composed largely of programs from both of its predecessor networks .  at its peak in ,  dumont was affiliated with around television stations .  in those days ,  television stations were free to cherry pick which programs they would air ,  and many stations affiliated with multiple networks ,  depending mainly on the number of commercial television stations available in a market at a given time markets where only one commercial station was available carried programming from all four major networks .  many of dumont s affiliates carried very little dumont programming ,  choosing to air one or two more popular programs such as life is worth living and or sports programming on the weekends .  few stations carried the full dumont program lineup .  in its later years ,  dumont was carried mostly on poorly watched uhf channels or had only secondary affiliations on vhf stations .  dumont ended most operations on april ,  but honored network commitments until august .  once the team arrived in australia ,  jardine quickly alienated the press by refusing to give team details before a match and being uncooperative during interviews .  the press printed some negative stories as a result and the crowds barracked as they had done on his previous tour ,  which angered him .  during the season ,  woodfull s physical courage ,  stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers .  he flatly refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit .  there is no way i will be influenced to adopt such tactics which bring such discredit to the game .  i know tim could do it but i am not going to participate in actions that can only hurt the game .  i don t want to see you ,  mr warner .  there are two teams out there ,  one is playing cricket .  the other is making no attempt to do so .  the next day ,  larwood fractured wicket keeper bert oldfield s skull .  this occurred when oldfield mis hit a hook ,  which flew from the top edge off a traditional non bodyline ball oldfield later admitted it was his fault .  as a result of the injuries ,  the costs of insurance cover for players doubled .  at the end of the fourth day s play the australian board of control for cricket sent the following cable to the mcc in london as a direct consequence of the tour ,  the mcc introduced a new rule to the laws of cricket for the english cricket season .  originally ,  the mcc hoped that captains would ensure that the game was played in the correct spirit ,  and passed a resolution that bodyline bowling would breach this spirit .  when this proved to be insufficient ,  the mcc passed a law that direct attack bowling was unfair and became the responsibility of the umpires to identify and stop .  in ,  the laws were altered to prevent more than two fielders standing behind square on the leg side the intention was to prevent negative bowling tactics whereby off spinners and slow inswing bowlers aimed at the leg stump of batsmen with fielders concentrated on the leg side .  however ,  an indirect effect was to make bodyline fields impossible to implement .  to this day ,  the bodyline tour remains one of the most significant events in the history of cricket ,  and strong in the consciousness of many cricket followers .  in a poll of cricket journalists ,  commentators ,  and players in ,  the bodyline tour was ranked the most important event in cricket history .  over the years waterfall gully has been extensively logged ,  and early agricultural interests saw the cultivation of a variety of introduced species as crops ,  along with the development of local market gardens and nurseries .  attempts to mine the area were largely unsuccessful ,  but the region housed one of the state s earliest water powered mills ,  and a weir erected in the early s provided for part of the city of burnside s water supply .  today the suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks .  while the route to the falls from eagle on the hill was on public land ,  the alternative route along the gully was through private properties .  nevertheless ,  many visitors chose this route ,  and a combination of public demand and a desire from some of the landowners for improved access to and from their properties especially from the mgge family led to pressure to build a road through the gully .  although there was opposition from some of the locals ,  the waterfall gully road was built in the late s .  the land remained under the burnside council s control until ,  when the waterfall gully reserve was reclaimed by the government as the first national pleasure resort in the state .  initially the reserve was placed under the jurisdiction of the national parks advisory board ,  but later it was moved to the tourist bureau ,  before finally becoming part of the national park commission s portfolio .  the census area that incorporates waterfall gully has a larger proportion of those in both the younger and older age ranges than in the city of burnside as a whole ,  and there have been no numerically significant changes in the age distribution between the and censuses .  similarly ,  family numbers are also stable ,  with almost no change between and .  during a visit to the pyrenees during the summer of ,  tennyson

with america ,  and that this influenced his work on the album .  speaking of his encounter with comadres in el salvador and their impact on the song ,  he said ,  there s no question in my mind of the reagan administration s involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities .  i doubt if the people of america are even aware of this .  it s not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way ,  but it is affecting me and it affects the words i write and the music we make .  in ,  clayton noted we were looking at this america through a european lens ,  at a time when britain was under margaret thatcher who was breaking the miners .  so we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside america .  he said mothers of the disappeared was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in chile but also at the us which had supported that government ,  and described bono s vocals as prehistoric ,  saying it connects with something very primitive .  u debuted mothers of the disappeared on april in san diego ,  california ,  on the first leg of the joshua tree tour ,  where it closed the concert in place of the band s long time finale .  it was performed three more times on the leg twice to open the encore and once to conclude the main set .  u revived the song seven months later on the third leg ,  playing it in the encore at three of the final four concerts on the tour .  the cost of the tickets was too high for many fans in south america ,  so the band broadcast the february concert in chile live on television .  knowing that many people in the country would be watching ,  they played mothers of the disappeared in place of wake up dead man .  the stadium in which the concert was held had been used as a prison camp by pinochet s regime following the coup d tat .  again it was performed solely by bono and the edge against footage of the madres ,  and they invited the women to join them on stage a second time .  the madres held up photographs of their children and spoke about them briefly during the performance ,  an act which received a mixed reception from the audience .  bono made a plea to pinochet ,  asking him to tell these women where are the bones of their children .  mothers of the disappeared has been covered several times .  the vitamin string quartet included it on their tribute album the string quartet tribute to u s the joshua tree .  paddy casey recorded a version

generation .  she is the chief medical officer aboard the federation starship uss enterprise d .  her medical skills saved the lives of captain jean luc picard and commander william riker ,  and she helped inspire lt .  commander data to create a hologram of professor moriarty that became self aware .  pulaski preferred to avoid the transporter ,  but was forced to rely on it to save her own life from an alien infection .  before arriving on the enterprise d ,  she previously served on the uss repulse .  for a time ,  she was romantically involved with kyle riker ,  but they continued to remain friends .  towards the end of the first season of star trek the next generation ,  staff members convinced gene roddenberry to drop gates mcfadden as dr .  beverly crusher from the show .  executive producer rick berman opposed this decision .  to allow for mcfadden s return in the future ,  roddenberry wrote crusher s character out rather than killing her .  mcfadden s departure led to an opening for a new cast member .  the producers contacted american actress diana muldaur ,  unaware of her past involvement with roddenberry s star trek and planet earth pilot .  in the original series ,  muldaur played the role of a doctor in two episodes as dr .  ann mulhall in return to tomorrow ,  and as dr .  miranda jones in is there in truth no beauty ,  muldaur also worked on the pilot for planet earth after getting to know roddenberry and his wife ,  majel barrett ,  through their annual star trek christmas parties .  the noisy miner is similar in appearance to the yellow throated miner and the black eared miner it has a dull white forehead and a black crown ,  while the others have grey heads .  the noisy miner also produces non vocal sounds by clicking or snapping its bill ,  usually during antagonistic encounters with other bird species ,  or when mobbing a predator .  in the first study to demonstrate different learning techniques in a single species ,  the noisy miner was found to employ different cognitive strategies depending upon the resource it was foraging .  when searching for nectar ,  which does not move but is readily depleted ,  the noisy miner uses a spatial memory based strategy ,  identifying characteristics of the environment a strategy that is efficient in new environments and is not affected by changes in the bird s activities .  when searching for invertebrates ,  it appears to employ a different strategy based on learned rules of insect movement they improve at finding invertebrates with practice .  the two different strategies imply the existence of adapted cognitive mechanisms ,  capable of responding appropriately to different foraging contexts .  cooperative breeding has been described as a strategy for decreasing nest predation ,  although one study found no relationship between the number of helpers visiting a nest site and its success or failure .  noisy miners were seen to have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including multiple broods ,  laying eggs early in the season ,  nesting low in the canopy and group mobbing of predators these measures did not guarantee against nest failure due to the diversity of potential predators in the noisy miner s open woodland habitat .  the principe amedeo class was a pair of ironclad warships built for the italian regia marina royal navy in the s and s .  they were the culmination of a major naval construction program designed to give italy a powerful fleet of ironclads .  the two ships ,  principe amedeo and palestro ,  were the last italian ironclads to feature sailing rigs and wooden hulls .  they were armed with a battery of six inch mm guns and were capable of a speed in excess of knots km h mph .  the ships had uneventful careers ,  spending much of it in italy s colonial empire .  by the late s ,  they were withdrawn from service and employed in secondary roles ,  first as headquarters ships for harbor defenses .  principe amedeo was converted into a depot ship in and was discarded in ,  while palestro was used as a training ship from to before being scrapped in .  the two ships were protected by iron belt armor that was .  in mm thick and extended for the entire length of the hull .  the casemates were protected with .  in mm of iron plating ,  and the small conning tower had .

available to prokaryotes .  the main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of dna during the cell cycle .  the nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells .  inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane ,  it contains the majority of the cell s genetic material .  this material is organized as dna molecules ,  along with a variety of proteins ,  to form chromosomes .  gene expression first involves transcription ,  in which dna is used as a template to produce rna .  in the case of genes encoding proteins ,  that rna produced from this process is messenger rna mrna ,  which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein .  as ribosomes are located outside the nucleus ,  mrna produced needs to be exported .  most eukaryotic cell types usually have a single nucleus ,  but some have no nuclei ,  while others have several .  this can result from normal development ,  as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells ,  or from faulty cell division .  as the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell ,  the nucleus evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation .  four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus ,  although none have yet earned widespread support .  until the whole world hears received a mixed to positive reception from

by giuseppe piazzi at palermo on january .  it was originally considered a planet ,  but was reclassified as an asteroid in the s when many other objects in similar orbits were discovered .  ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle ,  and may have a remnant internal ocean of liquid water under the layer of ice .  the surface is probably a mixture of water ice and various hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay .  in january ,  emissions of water vapor were detected from several regions of ceres .  this was unexpected ,  because large bodies in the asteroid belt do not typically emit vapor ,  a hallmark of comets ,  implying that recent geologic activity was probably involved in the creation of the bright spots .  in october ,  nasa released a true color portrait of ceres made by dawn .  as other objects were discovered in the neighborhood of ceres ,  it was realized that ceres represented the first of a new class of objects .  in ,  with the discovery of pallas ,  william herschel coined the term asteroid star like for these bodies ,  writing that they resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them ,  even by very good telescopes .  as the first such body to be discovered ,  ceres was given the designation ceres under the modern system of minor planet designations .  by the s ,  the existence of a fundamental difference between asteroids such as ceres and the major planets was widely accepted ,  though a precise definition of planet was never formulated .  ceres follows an orbit between mars and jupiter ,  within the asteroid belt ,  with a period of .  earth years .  the orbit is moderately inclined i .  compared to .  for mars .  the rotation period of ceres the cererian day is hours and minutes .  it has a small axial tilt of .  this is nevertheless large enough for ceres s polar regions to contain permanently shadowed craters that are expected to act as cold traps and accumulate water ice over time ,  similar to the situation on the moon and mercury .  about .  of water molecules released from the surface are expected to end up in the traps ,  hopping an average of times before escaping or being trapped .  ceres surface is relatively warm .  the maximum temperature with the sun overhead was estimated from measurements to be k approximately c ,  f on may .  ice is unstable at this temperature .  material left behind by the sublimation of surface ice could explain the dark surface of ceres compared to the icy moons of the outer solar system .  there are indications that ceres may have a tenuous water vapor atmosphere outgassing from water ice on the surface .  some notable observations and milestones for ceres include and visible light images with km resolution the best prior to the dawn mission taken using hubble .  ceres was found to have an atmosphere with water vapor ,  confirmed by the herschel space telescope .  the nasa dawn spacecraft approached and orbited ceres ,  sending detailed images and scientific data back to earth .  in the early s ,  nasa initiated the discovery program ,  which was intended to be a series of low cost scientific missions .  in ,  the program s study team recommended as a high priority a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine .  funding for this program remained problematic for several years ,  but by the dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review .  it was launched on september ,  as the space mission to make the first visits to both vesta and ceres .  on may ,  dawn acquired its first targeting image .  million kilometers from vesta .  after orbiting vesta for months ,  dawn used its ion engine to depart for ceres ,  with gravitational capture occurring on march at a separation of ,  km ,  four months prior to the new horizons flyby of pluto .  dawn s arrival in a stable orbit around ceres was delayed after ,  close to reaching ceres ,  it was hit by a cosmic ray ,  making it take another ,  longer route around ceres in back ,  instead of a direct spiral towards it .  eilean a che ,  which means island of the mist a translation of the

overall reduction in scottish island populations of per cent for the same period .  by the population had risen a further .  to ,  with scottish island populations as a whole growing by to ,  .  the unemployment rate in the area tends to be higher than in the highlands as a whole ,  and is seasonal in nature ,  in part due to the impact of tourism .  the population is growing and in common with many other scenic rural areas in scotland ,  significant increases are expected in the percentage of the population aged to years .  the hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland britain ,  but like most of the larger islands ,  skye still has a wide variety of species .  observing the abundance of game birds martin wrote similarly ,  samuel johnson noted that in recent years ,  fau has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while also evolving into a more traditional university .  the university has raised admissions standards ,  increased research funding ,  built new facilities ,  and established notable partnerships with major research institutions .  changes include an on campus stadium ,  additional on campus housing ,  and the establishment of a college of medicine in .  on july ,  to meet the burgeoning educational demands of south florida ,  the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the city of boca raton .  florida atlantic university was built on boca raton army airfield ,  a s era army airbase .  during world war ii ,  the airfield served as the army air corps sole radar training facility .  the base was built on the existing boca raton airport and on ,  acres .  km of adjacent land .  a majority of the land was acquired from japanese american farmers from the failing yamato colony .  the land was seized through eminent domain ,  leaving many japanese americans little recourse in the early days of world war ii .  the airbase was used for radar training ,  anti submarine patrols along the coast ,  and as a stop over point for planes being ferried to africa and europe via south america .  the airfield was composed of four runways ,  still visible on the boca campus today and mainly used for parking .  florida atlantic s history is one of continuing expansion as the university s service population has grown .  the university originally served only upper division and graduate level students ,  because florida intended the institution to complement the state s community college system ,  accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions .  in ,  the florida legislature recognized demands for higher education in south florida by designating florida atlantic as the lead state university serving broward county .  to fill this role ,  the university would establish a campus in dania beach in and another campus in the city of davie in western broward county in .  florida atlantic later purchased acres ha of land in port st .  lucie in to establish a campus on the treasure coast .  this would be the institution s fifth campus .  the university continued its expansion in when it opened its jupiter campus ,  named for the late john d .  macarthur .  this campus houses the university s honors college .  florida atlantic has changed dramatically since its opening in .  as of ,  there are more than ,  students attending classes on seven campuses spread across miles km .  the university consists of ten colleges and employs more than ,  faculty and staff .  the university s endowment decreased from million in june to million in january due to a worsening economy .  however ,  with the national economic recovery the endowment has increased to million by the end of .  the average class size at fau for undergraduates is students ,  and for graduate classes ,  students .  the student to faculty ratio is .  the top three undergraduate majors by enrollment are elementary education ,  accounting ,  and management ,  respectively .  the top three graduate majors by enrollment are business administration ,  educational leadership ,  and accounting ,  respectively .  the average age for first year students is however ,  the average age for all undergraduates is and the average age for graduate students is .  the average year graduation rate for first time ,  non transfer students is while the year graduation rate is .  florida atlantic university is a distributed university located on seven campuses spread across palm beach ,  broward ,  and st .  lucie counties .  the region is home to more than three million people .  the university s main campus is located in the city of boca raton in palm beach county .  the county is also home to the john d .  macarthur campus located in the city of jupiter .  in addition to its campuses in palm beach county ,  the university operates three campuses in the broward county cities of dania beach ,  davie ,  and fort lauderdale .  florida atlantic university also operates two campuses in the st .  lucie county cities of port st .  lucie and fort pierce .  in addition to students who attend classes on the universities campuses ,  there are ,  distance learning students who conduct their studies over the internet or through other means .  these students account for of the university s student body .  in addition to the treasure coast campus ,  florida atlantic university operates a campus in fort pierce at the harbor branch oceanographic institution .  harbor branch merged with the university in to become the hboi at fau .  the florida legislature allocated million for the university to acquire the institution and its acre .  km campus .  in ,  the florida atlantic football team finished six wins and six losses in regular season play and was invited to the motor city bowl .  the owls defeated central michigan university ,  increasing their bowl record to two wins and zero losses .  during the previous season ,  the football team beat troy university in the final game of regular season play to become sun belt co champions and receive an invitation to the new orleans bowl .  in just the seventh year of the football program s history ,  and the third year playing in division i ,  florida atlantic set ncaa records by both becoming the youngest program ever to receive an invitation to ,  and win ,  a bowl game .  as a result of the new orleans bowl the university has seen a surge in school spirit .  in past seasons the owls have garnered a number of accolades for their accomplishments .  during the season ,  the men s basketball team was noted as one of the sun belt conference s top offensive teams ,  with a scary offense that earned it the reputation of the best shooting team in the conference .  in ,  the men s basketball team defeated its first ever southeastern conference opponent mississippi state university as well as big east opponent the university of south florida en route to a overall record and claimed the sun belt conference title .  florida atlantic university is home to a number of sports related traditions and school spirit organizations .  residential housing at florida atlantic university is available on the boca raton and john d .  macarthur campuses .  all full time freshmen are required to reside in university housing ,  however ,  exemptions from this policy are made for students who are or older by the first day of class ,  reside with parent s or legal guardian s within a mile km radius of the boca raton campus ,  or are married .  as of ,  students live on campus in boca raton .  the wilkes honors college on the macarthur campus requires all students live on campus within its two residence halls ,  however ,  exceptions are made for students who are years of age ,  married ,  or have dependent children .  as of ,  there are students residing on campus at the honors college .  the book has been reviewed in usa today ,  business week ,  energy priorities ,  sustainability investment news and several other magazines ,  and has been translated into seven languages .  clean tech nation is the sequel to the clean tech revolution .  the authors present a list of drivers for clean tech high energy prices ,  depleted natural resources ,  volatile sources of foreign oil ,  record deficits ,  and unprecedented environmental and security challenges .  the central message ,  which is repeated in almost every chapter ,  is that a clean tech revolution with benefit humanity worldwide ,  and will require significant collaboration between the public and private sectors .  the authors say that nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies .  apart from the risks associated with nuclear power ,  multibillion dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost effective when compared with other energy sources .  the authors also believe that clean coal is an oxymoron for a myriad of reasons ,  including the sheer number of coal mine related deaths and the fact that coal fired plants ,  even some cleaner ones ,  are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma ,  heart disease ,  and mercury poisoning .  pernick and wilder identify six major forces ,  which they call the six c s ,  that are pushing clean technology into the mainstream and driving rapid growth and expansion costs ,  capital ,  competition ,  china ,  consumers ,  and climate .  capital .  an unprecedented influx of capital is changing the clean tech landscape ,  with billions of dollars ,  euros ,  yen ,  and yuan pouring in from a myriad of public and private sector sources .  climate .  the debate around climate change has gone from question mark to peer reviewed certainty ,  and smart businesses are taking heed .  the clean tech revolution was followed by the book clean tech nation how the u . s .  can lead in the new global economy .  the missouri river is the longest river in north america .  rising in the rocky mountains of western montana ,  the missouri flows east and south for ,  miles ,  km before entering the mississippi river north of st .  louis ,  missouri .  the river takes drainage from a sparsely populated ,  semi arid watershed of more than half a million square miles ,  km ,  which includes parts of ten u . s .  states and two canadian provinces .  when combined with the lower mississippi river ,  it forms the world s fourth longest river system .  for over ,  years ,  people have depended on the missouri river and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation .  more than ten major groups of native americans populated the watershed ,  most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous buffalo herds that once roamed through the great plains .  the first europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century ,  and the region passed through spanish and french hands before finally becoming part of the united states through the louisiana purchase .  the missouri was long believed to be part of the northwest passage a water route from the atlantic to the pacific but when lewis and clark became the first to travel the river s entire length ,  they confirmed the mythical pathway to be no more than a legend .  the missouri s drainage basin has highly variable weather and rainfall patterns ,  overall ,  the watershed is defined by a continental climate with warm ,  wet summers and harsh ,  cold winters .  most of the watershed receives an average of to inches to mm of precipitation each year .  however ,  the westernmost portions of the basin in the rockies as well as southeastern regions in missouri may receive as much as inches ,  mm .  the vast majority of precipitation occurs in winter ,  although the upper basin is known for short lived but intense summer thunderstorms such as the one which produced the black hills flood through rapid city ,  south dakota .  winter temperatures in montana ,  wyoming and colorado may drop as low as f c ,  while summer highs in kansas and missouri have reached f c at times .  over significant tributaries and hundreds of smaller ones feed the missouri river ,  with most of the larger ones coming in as the river draws close to the mouth .  most rivers and streams in the missouri river basin flow from west to east ,  following the incline of the great plains however ,  some eastern tributaries such as the james ,  big sioux and grand river systems flow from north to south .  see also list of locks and dams of the upper mississippi river ,  list of locks and dams of the ohio river meriwether lewis and william clark began their famed expedition in with a party of thirty three people in three boats .  although they became the first europeans to travel the entire length of the missouri and reach the pacific ocean via the columbia ,  they found no trace of the northwest passage .  the maps made by lewis and clark ,  especially those of the pacific northwest region ,  provided a foundation for future explorers and emigrants .  they also negotiated relations with multiple native american tribes and wrote extensive reports on the climate ,  ecology and geology of the region .  many present day names of geographic features in the upper missouri basin originated from their expedition .  the first glowing reports of country rich with thousands of game animals came in when meriwether lewis and william clark returned from their two year expedition .  their journals described lands rich with thousands of buffalo ,  beaver ,  and river otter and also an abundant population of sea otters on the pacific northwest coast .  in ,  explorer manuel lisa organized an expedition which would lead to the explosive growth of the fur trade in the upper missouri river country .  lisa and his crew traveled up the missouri and yellowstone rivers ,  trading manufactured items in return for furs from local native american tribes ,  and established a fort at the confluence of the yellowstone and a tributary ,  the bighorn ,  in southern montana .  although the business started small ,  it quickly grew into a thriving trade .  as settlers expanded their holdings into the great plains ,  they ran into land conflicts with native american tribes .  this resulted in frequent raids ,  massacres and armed conflicts ,  leading to the federal government creating multiple treaties with the plains tribes ,  which generally involved establishing borders and reserving lands for the indigenous .  as with many other treaties between the u . s .  and native americans ,  they were soon broken ,  leading to huge wars .  over ,  battles ,  big and small ,  were fought between the u . s .  military and native americans before the tribes were forced out of their land onto reservations .  in the late th and early th centuries ,  a great number of dams were built along the course of the missouri ,  transforming percent of the river into a chain of reservoirs .  river development was stimulated by a variety of factors ,  first by growing demand for electricity in the rural northwestern parts of the basin ,  and also by floods and droughts that plagued rapidly growing agricultural and urban areas along the lower missouri river .  small ,  privately owned hydroelectric projects have existed since the s ,  but the large flood control and storage dams that characterize the middle reaches of the river today were not constructed until the s .  the missouri basin suffered a series of catastrophic floods around the turn of the th century ,  most notably in ,  and .  in ,  as part of the great depression era new deal ,  the u . s .  army corps of engineers usace completed fort peck dam in montana .  construction of this massive public works project provided jobs for more than ,  laborers during the depression and was a major step in providing flood control to the lower half of the missouri river .  however ,  fort peck only controls runoff from percent of the missouri river watershed ,  and had little effect on a severe snowmelt flood that struck the lower basin three years later .  this event was particularly destructive as it submerged manufacturing plants in omaha and kansas city ,  greatly delaying shipments of military supplies in world war ii .  flooding damages on the mississippi missouri river system were one of the primary reasons for which congress passed the flood control act of ,  opening the way for the usace to develop the missouri on a massive scale .  the act authorized the pick sloan missouri basin program pick sloan plan ,  which was a composite of two widely varying proposals .  the pick plan ,  with an emphasis on flood control and hydroelectric power ,  called for the construction of large storage dams along the main stem of the missouri .  the sloan plan ,  which stressed the development of local irrigation ,  included provisions for roughly smaller dams on tributaries .  by tonnage of transported material ,  missouri is by far the largest user of the river accounting for percent of river traffic ,  while kansas has percent ,  nebraska three percent and iowa two percent .  almost all of the barge traffic on the missouri river ships sand and gravel dredged from the lower miles km of the river the remaining portion of the shipping channel now sees little to no use by commercial vessels .  restoration projects have re mobilized some of the sediments that had been trapped behind bank stabilization structures ,  prompting concerns of exacerbated nutrient and sediment pollution locally and downstream in the northern gulf of mexico .  a national research council report assessed the roles of sediment in the missouri river ,  evaluating current habitat restoration strategies and alternative ways to manage sediment .  the report found that a better understanding of sediment processes in the missouri river ,  including the creation of a sediment budget an accounting of sediment transport ,  erosion ,  and deposition volumes for the length of the missouri river would provide a foundation for projects to improve water quality standards and protect endangered species .  in north central montana ,  some ,  acres ,  km along over miles km of the missouri river ,  centering on fort peck lake ,  comprise the charles m .  russell national wildlife refuge .  the wildlife refuge consists of a native northern great plains ecosystem that has not been heavily affected by human development ,  except for the construction of fort peck dam .  although there are few designated trails ,  the whole preserve is open to hiking and camping .  in its original broadcast ,  monty can t buy me love was seen by approximately .  million viewers ,  and finished in rd place in the ratings the week it aired .  following the release of the simpsons the complete tenth season ,  the episode received mixed reviews from critics .  the assault troops ,  mostly from the australian and new zealand army corps anzac ,  landed at night on the western aegean sea side of the peninsula .  they were put ashore one mile .  km north of their intended landing beach .  in the darkness ,  the assault formations became mixed up ,  but the troops gradually made their way inland ,  under increasing opposition from the ottoman turkish defenders .  not long after coming ashore the anzac plans were discarded ,  and the companies and battalions were thrown into battle piece meal ,  and received mixed orders .  some advanced to their designated objectives while others were diverted to other areas ,  then ordered to dig in along defensive ridge lines .  since the anniversary of the landings on april has been commemorated as anzac day ,  becoming one of the most important national celebrations in australia and new zealand .  the anniversary is also commemorated in turkey ,  the united kingdom and ireland .  the ottoman turkish empire entered the first world war on the side of the central powers on october .  the stalemate of trench warfare on the western front convinced the british imperial war cabinet that an attack on the central powers elsewhere ,  particularly turkey ,  could be the best way of winning the war .  from february this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the dardanelles ,  but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary .  to that end ,  the mediterranean expeditionary force was formed under the command of general ian hamilton .  three amphibious landings were planned to secure the gallipoli peninsula ,  which would allow the navy to attack the turkish capital constantinople ,  in the hope that would convince the turks to ask for an armistice .  the location chosen for the operation was between the headland of gaba tepe and the fisherman s hut ,  three miles .  km to the north .  landing at dawn after a naval gunfire bombardment ,  the first troops were to seize the lower crests and southern spurs of hill .  the second wave would pass them to capture the spur of hill ,  especially mal tepe .  there they would be positioned to cut the enemy s lines of communications to the kilid bahr plateau ,  thus preventing the turks from bringing reinforcements from the north to the kilid bahr plateau during the attack by the british th division which would advance from a separate beachhead further south west .  the capture of mal tepe was more vital and valuable than the capture of the kilid bahr plateau itself .  birdwood planned to arrive off the peninsula after the moon had set ,  with the first troops landing at ,  an hour before dawn .  he declined the offer of an old merchant ship ,  loaded with troops ,  being deliberately grounded at gaba tepe .  instead ,  the troops were to travel in naval and merchant ships ,  transferring to rowing boats towed by small steamboats to make the assault .  men from the th and th battalions started up the ari burnu slope ,  grabbing the gorse branches or digging their bayonets into the soil to provide leverage .  at the peak they found an abandoned trench ,  the turks having withdrawn inland .  soon the australians reached plugge s plateau ,  the edge of which was defended by a trench ,  but the turks had withdrawn to the next summit two hundred yards m inland ,  from where they fired at the australians coming onto the plateau .  as they arrived ,  major edmund brockman of the th battalion started sorting out the mess ,  sending the th battalion s men to the right flank ,  the th battalion s to the left ,  and keeping the th battalion in the centre .  the second six companies landed while it was still dark ,  the destroyers coming to within five hundred yards m to disembark the troops ,  under fire .  they also landed at anzac cove ,  but now as planned the th were in the north ,  th in the centre and the th in the south .  the th battalion landed all along the beach .  this extended the beachhead yards m to the north of ari burnu ,  and .  miles .  km to the south .  landing under fire ,  some of the assaulting troops were killed in their boats ,  and others as they reached the beach .  once ashore they headed inland .  in the south ,  the first men from the th and th battalions reached the bottom of plateau .  baby is a hill in the sari bair range ,  next to battleship hill or big .  it was named after its supposed height above sea level ,  though its actual height is only feet m .  maclagen sent the th battalion ,  captain joseph lalor s company of the th battalion and major james robertson s of the th ,  towards baby .  brockman divided his own company ,  sending half up the right fork of rest gully ,  and half up the left ,  while brockman and a reserve platoon headed up monash valley .  as they moved forward ,  turkish artillery targeted them with air burst shrapnel shells ,  which dispersed the companies .  this ,  coupled with senior officers diverting men to other areas instead of towards baby ,  meant only fragments of the units eventually reached baby .  at robertson and lalor decided to take their companies up baby .  instead of going round to the right like tulloch ,  they went straight up the centre ,  crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground .  a spur on their left ,  leading to suvla bay ,  was defended by a turkish trench system .  at turkish troops started moving down battleship hill ,  and for the next hour they exchanged fire .  where the spur joined baby ,  a group of australians from the th ,  th ,  and th battalions crossed malone s gully and charged the turkish trench .  a turkish machine gun on baby opened fire on them ,  forcing them back ,  followed by a general withdrawal of australian troops .  the turks had secured battleship hill and were now driving the australians off baby .  from his headquarters at the head of monash valley ,  maclagen could see the turks attacking ,  and started sending all available men towards baby .  the nd brigade landed between and ,  and the reserve st brigade landed between and ,  already putting the timetable behind schedule .  the nd brigade ,  which was supposed to be heading for baby on the left ,  were instead sent to the right to counter a turkish attack building up there .  at bridges and his staff landed finding no senior officers on the beach to brief them ,  they set out to locate the rd brigade headquarters .  the st brigade was on the opposite flank to the rd brigade and already getting involved in battles of its own ,  when its commander ,  colonel percy owen ,  received a request from maclagen for reinforcements .  owen sent two companies from the rd battalion and one from the st battalion swannell s to support the rd brigade .  soon after ,  lalor s company had been forced back to the nek and the turks were threatening to recapture russell s top ,  and at maclagen reported to bridges his doubts over being able to hold out .  in response bridges sent part of his reserve ,  two companies from the nd battalion gordon s and richardson s ,  to reinforce the rd brigade .  at swannell s company arrived at the foot of baby ,  joining the seventy survivors of robertson s and lalor s companies .  they immediately charged and chased the turks back over the summit of baby ,  then stopped and dug in .  the two nd battalion companies arrived alongside them ,  but all the companies had taken casualties ,  among the dead being swannell and robertson .  by this time most of the rd brigade men had been killed or wounded ,  and the line was held by the five depleted companies from the st brigade .  on the left ,  gordon s company nd battalion ,  with the th and th battalion s survivors ,  charged five times and captured the summit of baby ,  but were driven back by turkish counter attacks gordon was among the casualties .  for the second time maclagen requested reinforcements for baby ,  but the only reserves bridges had available were two nd battalion companies and the th battalion .  it was now and the advance companies of the st new zealand brigade were disembarking ,  so it was decided they would go to baby .  the new zealand brigade commander had been taken ill ,  so birdwood appointed brigadier general harold walker ,  a staff officer already ashore ,  as commander .  the auckland battalion had landed by ,  and were being sent north along the beach to walker s ridge on their way to russell s top .  seeing that the only way along the ridge was in single file along a goat track ,  walker ordered them to take the route over plugge s plateau .  as each new zealand unit landed they were directed the same way to baby .  however ,  in trying to avoid turkish fire ,  they became split up in monash valley and rest gully ,  and it was after midday that two of the auckland companies reached baby .  the plateau ,  named for its height above sea level ,  was a wide and level plateau on the second ridge line ,  about six hundred by six hundred yards by m wide and around one thousand yards m from gun ridge .  the northern half of the plateau became known as johnston s jolly ,  and the southern half as lone pine ,  with owen s gully between them .  at mccay signalled bridges that large numbers of unwounded men were leaving the battlefield and heading for the beaches .  this was followed by maclagan asking for urgent artillery fire support ,  onto gun ridge ,  as his left was under a heavy attack and at owen reported the left flank was rapidly being forced to retire .  at dusk maclagan made his way to bridges headquarters and when asked for his opinion replied it s touch and go .  if the turks come on in mass formation .  i don t think anything can stop them .  as it got dark the turkish artillery ceased firing ,  and although small arms fire continued on both sides ,  the effects were limited when firing blind .  darkness also provided the opportunity to start digging more substantial trenches and to resupply the troops with water and ammunition .  the last significant action of the day was at south of lone pine ,  when the turks charged towards bolton s ridge .  by now the th battalion had positioned two machine guns to cover their front ,  which caused devastation amongst the attackers ,  and to their left the th battalion also became involved .  when the turks got to within fifty yards m the th battalion counter attacked in a bayonet charge and the turks withdrew .  the anzac defence was aided by royal navy searchlights providing illumination .  both sides now waited for the next attack ,  but the day s events had shattered both formations and they were no longer in any condition to conduct offensive operations .  by nightfall ,  around sixteen thousand men had been landed ,  and the anzacs had formed a beachhead ,  although with several undefended sections .  it stretched along bolton s ridge in the south ,  across plateau ,  to monash valley .  after a short gap it resumed at pope s hill ,  then at the top of walker s ridge .  it was not a large beachhead it was under two miles .  km in length ,  with a depth around yards m ,  and in places only a few yards separated the two sides .  that evening birdwood had been ashore to check on the situation ,  and ,  satisfied ,  returned to hms queen .  around he was asked to return to the beachhead .  there he met with his senior officers ,  who asked him to arrange an evacuation .  unwilling to make that decision on his own he signalled hamilton in the following days there were several failed attacks and counter attacks by both sides .  the turks were the first to try during the second attack on anzac cove on april ,  followed by the anzacs who tried to advance overnight may .  the turkish third attack on anzac cove on may was the worst defeat of them all ,  with around ten thousand casualties ,  including three thousand dead .  the next four months consisted of only local or diversionary attacks ,  until august when the anzacs ,  in connection with the landing at suvla bay ,  attacked chunuk bair with only limited success .  the turks never succeeded in driving the australians and new zealanders back into the sea .  similarly ,  the anzacs never broke out of their beachhead .  instead ,  in december ,  after eight months of fighting ,  they evacuated the peninsula .  the episode received mostly positive reviews ,  which ranged from okay to fabulous ,  with approval being given to the resurrection of neglected storylines from the show s first season .  one of these was the adoption of beth ,  and critics were especially happy with the scene where puck meets her ,  but there was widespread disdain for the explanation behind shelby s return ,  that of starting a rival glee club .  there were only three musical numbers in the episode ,  though all three were given positive notices ,  with the overall favorite being blaine s performance of something s coming from west side story at the end of the episode .  all three songs were released as singles ,  available for download ,  and somewhere

to .  records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known ,  and early drawings of biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters it is not until the early th century that the names mary and eliza chulkhurst were first used .  in ,  the bread and cheese lands were sold for housing ,  and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably ,  providing the widows and pensioners of biddenden with cheese ,  bread and tea at easter and with cash payments at christmas .  biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of biddenden each easter ,  and are sold as souvenirs to visitors .  in the disorder and indecency of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the archbishop of canterbury .  the distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church it was moved to the church porch .  as the annual dole grew larger the easter distribution became increasingly popular .  in a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at easter ,  the first recorded mention of the names eliza and mary chulkhurst ,  and clay replicas of biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs .  in almost all drawings and biddenden cake designs ,  the twins are shown as conjoined at both the hip and the shoulder .  although such a fusion is theoretically possible ,  in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere ,  no case of a viable double fusion has ever been documented .  lfric died on november and was buried in abingdon abbey ,  later being

american library ,  pages ,  paperback as a method of birth control ,  male condoms have the advantages of being inexpensive ,  easy to use ,  having few side effects ,  and offering protection against sexually transmitted infections .  with proper use and use at every act of intercourse women whose partners use male condoms experience a per year pregnancy rate .  with typical use the rate of pregnancy is per year .  condoms have been used for at least years .  since the th century ,  they have been one of the most popular methods of contraception in the world .  while widely accepted in modern times ,  condoms have generated some controversy ,  primarily over what role they should play in sex education classes .  the typical use pregnancy rate among condom users varies depending on the population being studied ,  ranging from to per year .  the perfect use pregnancy rate of condoms is per year .  condoms may be combined with other forms of contraception such as spermicide for greater protection .  condoms may slip off the penis after ejaculation ,  break due to improper application or physical damage such as tears caused when opening the package ,  or break or slip due to latex degradation typically from usage past the expiration date ,  improper storage ,  or exposure to oils .  the rate of breakage is between .  and ,  while the rate of slippage is between .  and .  even if no breakage or slippage is observed ,  of women will test positive for semen residue after intercourse with a condom .  different modes of condom failure result in different levels of semen exposure .  if a failure occurs during application ,  the damaged condom may be disposed of and a new condom applied before intercourse begins such failures generally pose no risk to the user .  one study found that semen exposure from a broken condom was about half that of unprotected intercourse semen exposure from a slipped condom was about one fifth that of unprotected intercourse .  among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control ,  pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom .  the person may have run out of condoms ,  or be traveling and not have a condom with them ,  or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to take a chance .  this type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure as opposed to method or perfect use failure .  the most common non latex condoms are made from polyurethane .  condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials ,  such as at resin ,  and most recently polyisoprene .  polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms ,  with most polyurethane condoms between .  mm and .  mm thick .  however ,  polyurethane condoms are less elastic than latex ones ,  and may be more likely to slip or break than latex ,  lose their shape or bunch up more than latex ,  and are more expensive .  in march ,  the swiss government announced that it was planning to promote smaller condoms intended for boys and youths of years old following concern about the pregnancy rate among adolescent girls ,  and also about the potential spread of aids among this age group .  this was due to the fact that standard condoms were too wide and consequently failed to afford protection to adolescent boys during vaginal and anal intercourse .  family planning groups and the swiss aids federation had campaigned to have a narrower condom produced for youths after a number of studies ,  including a government study researched at the centre for development and personality psychology at basel university ,  found that standard condoms were unsuitable for boys in this age range ,  and that the condoms either failed during use or that the boys rejected them altogether because they were too wide ,  and consequently they used no protection at all .  the anti rape condom is another variation designed to be worn by women .  it is designed to cause pain to the attacker ,  hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape .  some condom like devices are intended for entertainment only ,  such as glow in the dark condoms .  these novelty condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and stds .  the prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries .  most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women ,  or women in informal unions .  japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world in that country ,  condoms account for almost of contraceptive use by married women .  on average ,  in developed countries ,  condoms are the most popular method of birth control of married contraceptive users rely on condoms .  in the average less developed country ,  condoms are less common only of married contraceptive users choose condoms .  the german military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers ,  beginning in the later th century .  early th century experiments by the american military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases .  during world war i ,  the united states and at the beginning of the war only britain were the only countries with soldiers in europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use .  however ,  european militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection ,  even in countries where they were illegal for the general population .  through the s ,  catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items ,  including condoms and cigarettes .  quality testing became more common ,  involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure .  worldwide ,  condom sales doubled in the s .  throughout world war ii ,  condoms were not only distributed to male u . s .  military members ,  but also heavily promoted with films ,  posters ,  and lectures .  european and asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war ,  even germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in .  in part because condoms were readily available ,  soldiers found a number of non sexual uses for the devices ,  many of which continue to this day .  after learning in the early s that aids can be a sexually transmitted infection ,  the use of condoms was encouraged to prevent transmission of hiv .  despite opposition by some political ,  religious ,  and other figures ,  national condom promotion campaigns occurred in the u . s .  and europe .  these campaigns increased condom use significantly .  worldwide condom use is expected to continue to grow one study predicted that developing nations would need .  billion condoms by .  as of september ,  condoms are available inside prisons in canada ,  most of the european union ,  australia ,  brazil ,  indonesia ,  south africa ,  and the us states of vermont on september ,  the californian senate approved a bill for condom distribution inside the state s prisons ,  but the bill was not yet law at the time of approval .  the term condom first appears in the early th century .  its etymology is unknown .  in popular tradition ,  the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of england s king charles ii ,  one dr .  condom or earl of condom .  there is however no evidence of the existence of such a person ,  and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before king charles ii ascended to the throne .  some moral and scientific criticism of condoms exists despite the many benefits of condoms agreed on by scientific consensus and sexual health experts .  roman catholic church opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage ,  as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by direct and intentional acts for example ,  surgery to prevent conception or foreign objects for example ,  condoms .  the roman catholic church is the largest organized body of any world religion .  the church has hundreds of programs dedicated to fighting the aids epidemic in africa ,  but its opposition to condom use in these programs has been highly controversial .  as an example ,  latino immigrants in the united states often face cultural barriers to condom use .  a study on female hiv prevention published in the journal of sex health research asserts that latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender role norms in the latino community ,  and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners .  women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general machismo subtly encouraged in latino culture ,  their male partners would be angry or possibly violent at the woman s suggestion that they use condoms .  a similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low income american black women the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used .  middle eastern couples who have not had children ,  because of the strong desire and social pressure to establish fertility as soon as possible within marriage ,  rarely use condoms .  construction of the first four ships was plagued with difficulties as the soviet shipbuilding and related industries were not prepared to build such large ships .  one battleship ,  sovetskaya belorussiya ,  was cancelled on october after serious construction flaws were found .  construction of the other three ships was suspended shortly after nazi germany invaded the soviet union in june ,  and never resumed .  all three of the surviving hulls were scrapped in the late s .  the machinery arrangement provided good dispersal of the machinery spaces ,  but at the cost of very long runs for the wing shafts ca .  meters .  ft .  the turbine compartments for the wing shafts were located forward of boiler room no .  and aft of the no .  turret magazines .  the engine room for the center shaft s turbine was between boiler room no .  and no .  this meant that the wing propeller shafts had to run underneath the boilers .  maximum speed was estimated at knots ,  using the revised propeller design ,  although forcing the machinery would yield an extra knot .  the normal fuel oil capacity was ,  metric tons ,  long tons ,  giving an estimated endurance of ,  nautical miles ,  km ,  mi at .  knots .  km h .  mph and ,  nautical miles ,  km ,  mi at full speed .  maximum fuel capacity was ,  metric tons ,  long tons which gave a range of ,  nautical miles ,  km ,  mi at .  knots and ,  nautical miles ,  km ,  mi at full speed .  the main armament consisted of three electrically powered mk triple turrets ,  each with three caliber mm b guns .  the guns could be depressed to and elevated to .  they had a fixed loading angle of and their rate of fire varied with the time required to re aim the guns .  it ranged from .  to .  rounds per minute depending on the elevation .  the turrets could elevate at a rate of .  degrees per second and traverse at .

armament consisted of twelve caliber b mm guns mounted in six dual mk turrets .  their elevation limits were to with a fixed loading angle of .  their rate of fire also varied with the elevation from

forced the decision to replace cemented plates thicker than mm .  in with face hardened ones with less resistance in november .  the plants tended to compensate by making the thicker plates harder ,  but this often made them more brittle and large numbers did not pass the acceptance tests .  this would have significantly reduced the level of protection enjoyed by the sovetsky soyuz class ships in combat .  the forecastle deck was mm thick while the upper deck was mm .  in over the citadel .  below it ,  the mm middle deck acted as a splinter deck .  the upper deck was mm thick above the mm waterline belt extension .  the bottom edge of the forward splinter belt met with a mm .  in arched deck .  another arched deck of the same thickness covered the stern aft of the rear transverse bulkhead .  construction of all three ships was ordered halted on july ,  and the sovetsky soyuz was placed into long term conservation as the most advanced ship .  however ,  all three were officially stricken from the navy list on september .  underneath is the twelfth episode of the ninth season of the american science fiction television series the x files .  the episode first aired in the united states on march ,  on the fox network .  the episode was written and directed by executive producer john shiban .  the episode is a monster of the week episode ,  a stand alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology ,  or overarching fictional history ,  of the x files .  the episode earned a nielsen rating of .  and was viewed by .  million households and .  million viewers .  it received mixed reviews from critics .  underneath marked the directorial debut of shiban ,  who had been a writer for the series for several seasons .  reportedly ,  the episode contained so many problems that the fox executives nearly refused to allow the finished product to air .  at the last minute ,  however ,  they relented ,  and allowed the episode to be aired later on in the season ,  several weeks after its intended air date .  shiban originally wanted to film the sewer scenes in los angeles actual sewer system ,  but due to the events of september ,  a sewer mock up was built on stage at the fox studios .  underneath was written and directed by executive producer john shiban .  this marked his directorial debut .  according to shiban ,  part of the inspiration for the episode was that the series production staff had actually talked for some time about doing a jekyll hyde story but never quite found a way to do it until the idea to use dna came into play .  another inspiration for the episode was the film the third man ,  which featured a climactic chase through a sewage system .  the third street bridge is the major crossing of the creek ,  carrying t third street light rail line and third street .  it is a bascule type drawbridge .  the port of san francisco extended illinois street across islais creek in to relieve traffic for third street .  this crossing also uses a bascule bridge .  the cladogram below follows an analysis by andrew mcdonald ,  .  only two species assigned to iguanodon are still considered to be valid .  two species described

rare off season subtropical cyclone that hit georgia in may .  it developed from a previously non tropical cyclone in the western atlantic ocean ,  and initially it moved northeastward off of the carolinas .  the storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge ,  and concurrently it intensified to become subtropical storm alpha .  it later moved ashore near savannah ,  and it finally dissipated in the northeast gulf of mexico on may .  it produced wave action and moderate rainfall along the coast .  damage totaled over ,  usd ,  and there were two associated deaths .  the national hurricane center initially thought the center might not have been at the surface ,  and the agency indicated low forecasting confidence ,  as they could not determine a circulation center .  the difficulty arose from the large ,  sprawling nature of the storm ,  and by later on may a new center formed ,  as confirmed by radar imagery and the hurricane hunters .  that night ,  the extremely small center made landfall just south of savannah ,  georgia ,  affecting a very small area with winds of mph km h and a minimum pressure of mbar hpa .  inhg .  around the time of landfall ,  alpha developed a warm core ,  indicating some tropical characteristics .  the storm weakened quickly over land ,  although it did not dissipate until two days later over the northeast gulf of mexico .

game music album ,  while the chrono cross music selection mini album has garnered little attention .  songs from the soundtrack have been played at various orchestral concerts ,  such as the personal arrangements by mitsuda for the play ,  a video game symphony concert series .  chrono cross music has also been extensively remixed by fans ,  and such remixes have been included in both official and

bay city area .  at the apex of its length in the s ,  m stretched from webberville in the south to bay city state park in the north .  since interstate i opened in the tri cities area ,  the northern section of m was rerouted and truncated as a result of related changes to other highways .  the southern end was moved after i opened in the lansing area .  further changes into the s shortened m more ,  producing the routing in use today .  in june ,  a construction project began on the interchange with us at the route s northern terminus .  this construction consisted of bridge replacement over

mosley is the youngest son of sir oswald mosley ,  former leader of the british union of fascists buf ,  and diana mitford .  he was educated in france ,  germany and britain before going on to attend university at christ church ,  oxford ,  where he graduated with a degree in physics .  he then changed to law and was called to the bar in .  in his teens and early twenties mosley was involved with his father s post war political party ,  the union movement um .  he has said that the association of his surname with fascism stopped him from developing his interest in politics further ,  although he briefly worked for the conservative party in the early s .  mosley has rarely discussed his early political involvement with his father .  when his father oswald died ,  the london daily mail described him as a much maligned and much misunderstood political giant of his era .  certainly ,  his father s political presence affected his early years but mosley reflected on this time ,  i was born into this rather strange family and then at a certain point you get away from that .  whilst he has distanced himself from this period of his life ,  the misunderstanding has remained and today .  he carries that weight on his shoulders .  in the early s ,  mosley attempted a political career ,  working for the uk conservative party and hoping to become a parliamentary candidate .  bernie ecclestone s biographer ,  terry lovell ,  writes that he gave up this aspiration after being unimpressed by the calibre of senior party officials .  he also felt his name would be a handicap and has since said if i had a completely open choice in my life ,  i would have chosen party politics ,  but because of my name ,  that s impossible .  by the late s he had become a supporter of the uk labour party ,  following a meeting with then labour leader john smith .  while mosley was at university ,  his wife was given tickets to a motor race at the silverstone circuit .  the circuit is not far from oxford ,  and the couple went out of curiosity .  mosley was attracted by the sport ,  and when his career as a barrister was bringing in sufficient money ,  he started racing cars himself .  the sport s indifference to his background appealed to mosley the revised directive went into force in june ,  and banned sponsorship from ,  with a further three year extension for global sports such as formula one .  on october ,  the directive was successfully overturned in the european court of justice on the grounds that it was unlawful .  a new tobacco advertising directive took effect in july the financial times described mosley as furious that this was a year earlier than provided for under the directive .  as of ,  ferrari is the only f team to retain tobacco sponsorship ,  although the team carries no explicit branding in races because of the european legislation .  although the fia moved its headquarters out of the eu in ,  it returned in all of the f teams remain in europe ,  and six are in the uk ,  compared to seven of eleven at the end of .  in february ,  mosley announced his intention to stand again for the presidency in october of that year ,  saying that if successful this third term would be his last .  in december ,  mosley said that he still intended to stand down when his term ran out in october ,  but would take the final decision in june of that year .  mosley s close relationship with ecclestone ,  the sport s promoter ,  was criticised in early by sir jackie stewart ,  who suggested that mosley should resign in favour of a ceo from outside

holotype found by brown in .  the holotype skeleton is only missing the last section of the tail ,  and part of the forelimbs ,  but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales .  corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests .  the crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a corinthian helmet .  the most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization .  as in a trombone ,  sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest ,  and then get amplified when corythosaurus exhaled .  a corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity .  inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles ,  seeds ,  twigs ,  and fruits corythosaurus probably fed on all of these .  the two species of corythosaurus are both present in slightly different levels of the dinosaur park formation .  both still co existed with theropods and other ornithischians ,  like daspletosaurus ,  brachylophosaurus ,  parasaurolophus ,  scolosaurus

commonly known as the airborne cemetery ,  is a commonwealth war graves commission cemetery in oosterbeek ,  near arnhem ,  the netherlands .  it was established in and is home to graves from the second world war .  most of the men buried in the cemetery were allied servicemen killed in the battle of arnhem ,  an allied attempt to cross the rhine in ,  or in the liberation of the city the following year .  men killed in these battles are still discovered in the surrounding area even in the st century ,  and so the number of people interred in the cemetery continues to grow .  the ace

attorney and the professor layton series .  it was released for the nintendo ds in in japan and in in the west .  the ace attorney games are visual novel adventure games in which the player controls defense attorneys and defends their clients in several different episodes .  the gameplay is split into two types of sections investigations and courtroom trials .  during the investigations ,  the player searches the environments ,  gathering information and evidence ,  and talks to characters such as their client ,  witnesses ,  and the police .  once enough evidence has been collected ,  the game moves on to a courtroom trial section .  takumi felt that the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues ,  and then pull them together into one conclusion ,  and not have multiple possible endings .  he said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves ,  with their own choices ,  even though the game is linear .  he only spent little time on writing a backstory for phoenix before writing the first game s story ,  and instead made up dialogue and developed phoenix s personality as he went along .  he came up with the partner character maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them ,  giving them advice ,  than investigating on their own .  dual destinies was given a digital only release in the west .  this was partially because of the game s tight development schedule by releasing it digitally ,  capcom was able to release the english version close to the japanese release date .  two of the games have not been localized ace attorney investigations and dai gyakuten saiban ,  although the former has received a full fan translation .  the ace attorney series has been well received by critics ,  and has performed well commercially in december ,  it was capcom s th best selling series of all time ,  and in october ,  they called it one of their strongest intellectual properties ,  with more than .  million units sold worldwide .  by december ,  the series had sold over million units .  in the united states ,  the first game became surprisingly successful ,  forcing capcom to prepare at least three additional runs to meet the demand .  even before the supply conduit through sihanoukville was shut down ,  pavn had begun expanding its logistical system from southeastern laos the ho chi minh trail into northeastern cambodia .  pavn also launched an offensive campaign x against the cambodian army ,  quickly seizing large portions of the eastern and northeastern parts of the country ,  isolating and besieging or overrunning a number of cambodian cities including kampong cham .  communist forces then approached within miles km of the capital ,  phnom penh ,  spurring president nixon into action .  the main problems were the pressure of time and the desire of the u . s .  president for secrecy .  the cambodian monsoon ,  whose heavy rains would hamper operations ,  was only two months away .  by the order of the president ,  the state department did not notify the cambodian desk at the us embassy ,  saigon ,  the phnom penh embassy ,  or lon nol of the planning .  operational security was as tight as general abrams could make it .  there was to be no prior u . s .  logistical build up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists .  u . s .  brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive ,  while battalion commanders got only two or three days notice .  the following evening ,  nixon decided that we would go for broke and gave his authorization for the incursion .  the joint u . s .  arvn campaign would begin on may with the stated goals of reducing allied casualties in south vietnam assuring the continued withdrawal of u . s .  forces and enhancing the u . s .  saigon government position at the peace negotiations in paris .  in order to keep the campaign as low key as possible ,  general abrams had suggested that the commencement of the incursion be routinely announced from saigon .  at on april ,  however ,  president nixon appeared on all three u . s .  television networks to announce that it is not our power but our will and character that is being tested tonight and that the time has come for action .  he announced his decision to launch american forces into cambodia with the special objective of capturing cosvn ,  the headquarters of the entire communist military operation in south vietnam .  cosvn as a single headquarters for control of pavn operations in south vietnam probably did not exist ,  or ,  at least ,  was never found .  opposition to the incursion was expected to be heavy ,  but pavn nlf forces had begun moving westward two days before the advance began .  by may ,  macv reported only eight americans killed and wounded ,  low casualties for such a large operation .  there was only scattered and sporadic contact with delaying forces such as that experienced by elements of the u . s .  th armoured cavalry three kilometers inside cambodia .  pavn troops opened fire with small arms and rockets only to be blasted by tank fire and tactical airstrikes .  when the smoke had cleared ,  dead pavn soldiers were counted on the battlefield while only two u . s .  troops were killed during the action .  the north vietnamese had ample notice of the impending attack .  a march directive from the headquarters of the b front ,  captured during the incursion ,  ordered pavn nlf forces to break away and avoid shooting back .  our purpose is to conserve forces as much as we can .  the only surprised party amongst the participants in the incursion seemed to be lon nol ,  who had been informed by neither washington nor saigon concerning the impending invasion of his country .  he only discovered the fact after a telephone conversation with the head of the u . s .  mission ,  who had found out about it himself from a radio broadcast .  after the first week of operations ,  additional battalion and brigade units were committed to the operation ,  so that between and may ,  a total of ,  allied troops including u . s .  maneuver battalions were conducting operations inside cambodia .  due to increasing political and domestic turbulence in the u . s ,  president nixon issued a directive on may limiting the distance and duration of u . s .  operations to a depth of kilometers mi and setting a deadline of june for the withdrawal of all u . s .  forces to south vietnam .  aerial operations for the incursion got off to a slow start .  reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since macv believed that they might serve as a signal of intention .  the role of the air force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best ,  in part to preserve the secrecy of menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border .  within two months ,  however ,  the limit of the operational area was extended past the mekong ,  and u . s .  tactical aircraft were soon directly supporting cambodian forces in the field .  these missions were officially denied by the u . s .  and false coordinates were given in official reports to hide their existence .  defense department records indicated that out of more than ,  combat sorties flown in cambodia between july and february ,  approximately percent were flown outside the authorized freedom deal boundary .  the cambodian government was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way .  it has been argued by some scholars that the incursion heated up the civil war and helped the insurgent khmer rouge gather recruits to their cause .  foreign relations series karnow ,  stanley ,  vietnam a history .  new york viking books ,  .  kennedy ,  denis ,  tracks in the jungle in

varuna ,  still flowing in northern varanasi ,  and assi ,  today a small stream in the southern part of the city ,  near assi ghat .  the old city is located on the north shores of the ganges ,  bounded by varuna and assi .  over most of the last millennium ,  the city was known as banaras .  in the s ,  indian government decided to return to the sanskrit form varanasi however ,  banaras is still the predominant form used locally .  according to the city development plan for varanasi ,  approximately of varanasi s population is employed .  approximately are employed in manufacturing ,  work in trade and commerce ,  work in other services ,  work in transport and communication ,  work in agriculture ,  work in construction ,  and are marginal workers working for less than half of the year .  among manufacturing workers ,  work in spinning and weaving ,  work in metal ,  work in printing and publishing ,  work in electrical machinery ,  and the rest work in a wide variety of industry sectors .  varanasi s manufacturing industry is not well developed and is dominated by small scale industries and household production .  further information at religion in varanasi among the estimated ,  temples in varanasi ,  the temples most popular for worship are the kashi vishwanath temple of shiva the sankat mochan hanuman temple and the durga temple ,  known for monkeys that reside in the large trees nearby .  varanasi is twinned with in ,  the british government funded the installation of a magnetic observatory at greenwich .  the association continued to press for the construction of similar observatories around the world ,  and in their suggestions were accepted by the government and funds were provided .  in the british government and the royal society prepared four expeditions to build magnetic observation stations in cape town st .  helena hobart ,  tasmania and eventually toronto .  teams of royal artillery officers were sent out to take the measurements .  the team assigned to canada originally planned to build their observatory on saint helen s island off montreal ,  but the local rocks proved to have a high magnetic influence ,  and the decision was made to move to toronto instead .  the team arrived in ,  and set up camp at fort york in a disused barracks while construction started on new buildings .  the observatory was given acres .  ha of land to the west of king s college the ontario legislature now occupies the area on which the college was located .  in the royal society s project was concluded ,  and the observatory was set to be abandoned .  after a lengthy debate ,  the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation .  rather than disappearing like its three counterparts ,  the toronto observatory was upgraded ,  and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station see meteorological service of canada under the direction of the ministry of marine and fisheries .  during the expansion ,  the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure .  the atlantic hurricane season was the first season to use the saffir simpson hurricane scale ,  a scale developed in by herbert saffir and robert simpson to rate the intensity of tropical cyclones .  the season produced tropical and subtropical cyclones ,  of which only reached storm intensity ,  became hurricanes ,  and only reached major hurricane status .  although more active than the season ,  brought few storms of note .  nearly half of the season s storms affected land ,  one of which resulted in severe damage .  the first storm of the hurricane season ,  forming in mid april ,  developed more than a month before the official start of the season .  several other short lived ,  weak depressions formed before and during june however ,  none reached storm intensity .  the first named storm ,  alice ,  formed on july .  tracking generally to the north ,  alice also became the first hurricane of the season as well as the first known cyclone to impact bermuda during july .  shortly after alice dissipated over atlantic canada ,  another depression formed .  by the end of july ,  two more non developing depressions formed and the first subtropical cyclone ,  given the name alfa ,  developed off the east coast of the united states .  this storm was short lived and dissipated on august just offshore southern maine .  the first half august was relatively quiet ,  with only one depression forming .  however ,  later in the month ,  the season s second hurricane ,  brenda ,  formed in the northwestern caribbean .  peaking just below category status on the newly introduced saffir simpson hurricane scale ,  brenda made the first recorded landfall in the mexican state of campeche .  later in august ,  tropical storm christine became the easternmost forming tropical cyclone in the atlantic basin on record ,  developing over the western african country of guinea on august .  the system traveled for several thousand miles before dissipating in the eastern caribbean sea in early september .  at the start of the month ,  a new tropical storm formed in the gulf of mexico .  this storm ,  named delia ,  became the first known cyclone to make landfall in the same city twice .  after moving inland a second time ,  delia eventually dissipated on september .  as delia dissipated another depression formed in the same region ,  eventually making landfall in the same city as delia ,  freeport ,  texas .  another brief depression formed several days later .  on september ,  the strongest storm of the season ,  ellen ,  formed over the eastern atlantic .  after tracking northwest for several days ,  ellen eventually attained hurricane status as it turned westward .  several days later ,  the hurricane turned northeast due to an approaching frontal system .  shortly before becoming extratropical ,  ellen reached major hurricane intensity at a record northerly latitude .  in late september ,  a brief depression affected northern florida before dissipating .  after a week of inactivity ,  the second subtropical storm of the year formed over the central atlantic .  this storm ,  named bravo ,  gradually intensified ,  becoming fully tropical ,  at which time it was renamed fran ,  a few days later .  upon being renamed ,  fran had intensified into a hurricane and maintained this intensity for several days before dissipating east of the azores on october .  a few days after fran dissipated ,  the final named storm of the year formed in the central caribbean sea .  a slow moving system ,  gilda gradually intensified just below hurricane intensity before striking cuba and moving over the bahamas .  a few days after passing through the islands ,  gilda became the first storm on record to transition from a tropical cyclone into a subtropical cyclone .  a large storm ,  gilda eventually became extratropical near atlantic canada and dissipated later that month .  around the time gilda was dissipating ,  a weak depression briefly existed near the azores .  the final storm of the year was a strong depression in the southern caribbean sea .  this system was active for less than two days but may have briefly attained tropical storm intensity as it made landfall in southern nicaragua .  on july ,  the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of mph km h and a barometric pressure of mbar hpa .  inhg ,  as the eastern portion of the eyewall brushed bermuda .  after passing the island ,  alice began to accelerate in response to a mid level trough over the eastern united states and weakened .  by july ,  winds head decreased below hurricane intensity as the storm neared atlantic canada .  later that day ,  alice made landfall in eastern newfoundland with winds of mph km h before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone .  once back over water ,  brenda began to intensify ,  attaining hurricane status late on august .  the next day ,  a well defined eye had developed and the storm attained its peak intensity as a high end category hurricane with winds of mph km h and a minimum pressure of mbar hpa .  inhg .  the storm made landfall later that day near ciudad del carmen ,  mexico at this intensity ,  becoming the first hurricane on record to strike the region .  after moving inland ,  brenda rapidly weakened to a depression by the morning of august and dissipated later that day .  already suffering from severe flooding that killed at least people and left ,  homeless ,  hurricane brenda worsened the situation with torrential rainfall and additional flooding .  the storm killed at least people in the country .  following the damage wrought by brenda ,  a large earthquake struck the region ,  hampering relief efforts and collapsing numerous structures .  winds on land gusted up to mph km h ,  leading to severe wind damage .  two of the fatalities occurred in campeche after of the city was flooded .  this was considered the worst flooding in the city in over years .  an estimated ,  people were left homeless as a direct result of brenda throughout mexico .  offshore ,  a freighter with crewman became trapped in the storm after its engines failed .  they were safely rescued several days later once the storm had dissipated .  the easternmost forming atlantic tropical cyclone on record ,  tropical storm christine ,  originated as a tropical wave over africa in mid august .  as it neared the atlantic ocean ,  the wave spawned a tropical depression at .  w ,  over the country of guinea ,  unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression .  although it was already a depression ,  advisories on the storm were not issued until august ,  five days after its formation .  for several days ,  the depression maintained its intensity as it steadily tracked west across the atlantic .  it eventually attained tropical storm intensity on august .  despite the lack of aircraft reconnaissance in the region ,  the intensity was determined by wind readings from a german cargo ship that passed through the storm .  on august ,  the first reconnaissance mission into the storm found tropical storm force winds and the first advisory was issued that day ,  immediately declaring the system as tropical storm christine .  three days later ,  christine attained its peak intensity just below hurricane status with winds of mph km h and a minimum pressure of mbar hpa .  inhg .  shortly thereafter ,  increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the leeward islands .  as it passed over antigua on september ,  christine weakened to a tropical depression and eventually dissipated near the dominican republic later that day .  due to the erratic track of the storm along the texas coastline ,  widespread heavy rains fell in areas near the storm and in louisiana .  tides up to ft .  m ,  in addition to rainfall up to .  in mm ,  caused significant flooding in the galveston freeport area .  up to million was reported in damages to homes due to the flooding .  throughout louisiana ,  there was substantial flooding of farmland .  damages to crops amounted to million .  in addition to the flooding rains produced by delia ,  eight tornadoes also touched down due to the storm ,  injuring four people .  five people were killed during delia ,  two drowned during floods ,  two died in a car accident and the other died from a heart attack while boarding up his home .  on september ,  a tropical depression formed over the northwestern caribbean sea within a trough of low pressure extended southeastward from delia ,  which was situated over southeast texas at the time .  the depression remained weak until it reached the texas coastline on september .  once onshore ,  it produced significant rainfall ,  causing significant damage that was attributed to tropical storm delia .  after turning northeast and tracking inland ,  the depression quickly increased in forward speed before dissipating over north carolina on september .  the strongest storm of the season ,  hurricane ellen ,  began as a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of africa on september .  on the following day ,  the wave spawned an area of low pressure south of the cape verde islands that quickly became a tropical depression .  tracking northeast ,  the system intensified into a tropical storm on september after sustained winds of mph km h were reported by a french naval vessel however ,  due to sparse data on the storm ,  the first advisory on ellen was not issued for two more days .  a slightly elongated storm ,  ellen gradually intensified over the open atlantic and was steered by two troughs of low pressure .  on september ,  the storm took a nearly due west track and the system became increasingly organized ,  with an ill defined eye becoming present on satellite imagery .  heavy rain fell in association with the depression in parts of florida and georgia .  a maximum of .  in mm fell in orlando while several other areas recorded over in mm of rain .  over land ,  wind gusts reached mph km h in some locations .  offshore ,  swells produced by the system reached ft .  m ,  impacting several vessels in the region .  minor beach erosion and coastal flooding was reported in parts of south carolina as a result of the storm .  in parts of coastal georgia ,  high water resulted in several road closures and flooded a few homes .  police officers in savannah reported that wave were topping the local seawall however ,  no damage was reported .  the final hurricane of the season ,  fran ,  originated from an area of convection north of hispaniola on october .  by october ,  the system interacted with a mid tropospheric trough near the southeast united states ,  resulting in the formation of a surface low .  tracking eastward ,  showers and thunderstorms began to develop around the circulation however ,  the structure of the system was not fully tropical .  late on october ,  the cyclone had become sufficiently organized to be classified a subtropical depression .  cold air from the remnants of a cold front became entrained within the circulation however ,  the cold air gradually warmed .  the following day ,  winds increased to gale force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm ,  at which time it was given the name bravo .  the precursor to tropical storm gilda was a large convective system partially due to a tropical wave .  it gradually became better organized over the northwestern caribbean sea ,  and on october ,  a tropical depression formed off the coast of nicaragua .  as it drifted to the northeast ,  it strengthened to a tropical storm ,  peaking at mph km h winds .  before it hit the coast of cuba ,  it weakened enough to cause only minor damage .  by the time it struck the island ,  it had become very disorganized in nature .  on october ,  cool ,  dry air entered the newly developed convection ,  and as a result it transitioned into a subtropical cyclone .  gilda became the first tropical system to pass through a subtropical stage prior to becoming extratropical .  the large circulation continued northeast before becoming extratropical on october .  the remnants of gilda intensified as they tracked near atlantic canada ,  attaining a central pressure of mbar hpa .  inhg near cape race ,  newfoundland .  the system eventually dissipated near southern greenland on october .  gilda caused heavy rain and mudslides in jamaica ,  destroying six homes and killing six people .  in cuba ,  gilda dropped over in mm of rain ,  while mph km h winds were reported in the northern part of the country .  in the bahamas ,  gilda caused significant crop damage from heavy rainfall and high tides .  the storm s persistent strong currents and easterly winds caused moderate beach erosion on the east coast of the united states ,  mostly along the florida coast .  the extratropical remnants of the storm produced hurricane force wind gusts over parts of atlantic canada ,  peaking at mph km h however ,  no damage was reported .  on june ,  another depression formed along florida ,  this time just onshore near the georgia border .  the system slowly tracked northeastward before dissipating on june southeast of the north south carolina border .  as hurricane alice neared bermuda on july ,  a depression formed near the east coast of the united states however ,  the storm dissipated the following day .  on july ,  the first cape verde storm formed over the central atlantic .  this system did not intensify ,  remaining a weak depression and dissipated on july without affecting land .  the next day ,  a new depression formed over the southwestern caribbean sea near the coast of nicaragua .  the depression tracked over central america ,  briefly moving back over water in the gulf of honduras before making a second landfall in belize .  the system persisted over land for a few days before entering the eastern pacific late on july .  only one non developing depression formed during the month of august ,  an unusually eastward forming system .  the depression was first identified just offshore eastern africa on september ,  near where tropical storm christine formed later in the month .  tracking rapidly towards the west ,  the depression dissipated on september over open waters .  in addition to the two notable tropical depressions and two named storms in september ,  a slow moving depression formed south southeast of bermuda on september .  tracking generally northward ,  the depression dissipated early on september without affecting land .  upon the declaration of hurricane fran on october ,  a new depression formed southwest of the strengthening hurricane .  this system rapidly tracked northeast and dissipated two days later .  later that month ,  a slow moving depression formed near the azores .  this system tracked southeast and dissipated on october without affecting land .  the final system of the year formed near the northern coast of panama on november .  the depression was noted as a .  strong depression .  by the national hurricane center and may have briefly attained tropical storm intensity before making landfall in southern nicaragua on november the system dissipated later that day over land .  the following names were used for named storms tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in the north atlantic in .  storms were named christine ,  delia ,  ellen and fran for the first time in .  due to the relatively minimal impact caused by storms during the season ,  no names were retired in the spring of however ,  due to the addition of male names in ,  the list was removed and replaced with a new set of names .  the following names were used for subtropical storms in the atlantic basin for this year .  this year was the second and last year to use the phonetic alphabet .  although a storm was given the name bravo ,  it was renamed fran after acquiring tropical characteristics .  in late ,  amidst concerns of war in the pacific ,  the unit was deployed north to darwin in the northern territory ,  where they undertook garrison duties in the weeks following japan s entry into the war .  following japanese landings in malaya ,  the th embarked from darwin and were transferred to malaya ,  arriving in singapore in the final days of the fighting on the peninsula .  in the wake of the withdrawal of british and commonwealth forces to the island ,  the battalion was hastily deployed in support of the two australian brigades the nd and th brigades in the north western sector of the island .  during the initial japanese landing ,  elements of the battalion were heavily engaged around the landing beaches but they were outnumbered and over the course of the week the defenders were pushed back towards the centre of the island ,  towards the city of singapore .  they suffered heavy casualties during this time ,  before subsequently becoming prisoners of war after the fall of singapore .  lieutenant colonel michael anketell .  the th machine gun battalion received the following battle honours for its service during the second world war malaya ,  and singapore .  nixon entered as the front runner for the republican nomination .  however ,  polls suggested that in a head to head match up with incumbent president lyndon johnson ,  nixon trailed to .  later in january ,  nixon embarked on a tour of texas ,  where he lampooned president johnson s state of the union address ,  asking can this nation afford to have four more years of lyndon johnson s policies that have failed at home and abroad ,  at this time ,  reports suggested that nixon would formally announce his bid in february .  in early june ,  nixon continued to be regarded as the favorite to win the nomination ,  but observers noted that he had not yet locked up the nomination .  he still faced challenges from nelson rockefeller and ronald reagan ,  and was not on the ballot in california ,  where reagan won a large slate of delegates .  behind the scenes ,  nixon staff lobbied for delegates from favorite son candidates ,  resulting ,  in the backing of senator howard baker of tennessee ,  and his pledged delegates ,  as well as those delegates supporting senator charles percy of illinois .  after the assassination of robert kennedy ,  like the other candidates ,  nixon took a break from campaigning .  reports suggested that the assassination all but assured his nomination .  upon returning to the trail ,  nixon found that rockefeller had begun attacking him .  rockefeller described nixon as a man of the old politics who has great natural capacity not to do the right thing ,  especially under pressure .  nixon refused to respond to the jabs ,  stating that he would not participate in attacks .  as he edged closer to the nomination ,  discussions about his running mate arose .  republicans in the midwest pushed for mayor john lindsay of new york city .  the endorsement of nixon by senator mark hatfield of oregon raised speculation that he might be chosen .  congressman george bush of texas and senator percy were also mentioned as possible selections .  at the end of the month ,  nixon had two thirds of the required delegates necessary to win the nomination .  on july ,  nixon received the endorsement of senator john g .  tower of texas ,  handing him at least delegates .  with his nomination all but assured ,  nixon s ad team began preparing for the general election .  a series of advertisements featuring question and answer sessions with nixon and friends of campaign staffers were filmed in new york .  the tapes were sent to the swing states of illinois ,  michigan ,  and ohio ,  giving nixon the advantage of advertising long before the democratic party settled on a candidate .  at this time ,  nixon decided with a group of legislators that crime and disorder would be presented as the number one issue in the nation .  this continued to be a major theme of the nixon campaign ,  and would continue to be used extensively during the general election .  nixon publicly announced his opposition to the military draft ,  proposing to replace the current system with a volunteer army encouraged with higher pay .  president eisenhower endorsed nixon in mid july ,  breaking his tradition of waiting until after the primary ,  due to the election s importance .  by july s end ,  reports circulated that nixon had probable delegates for the convention ,  placing him over the delegate threshold ,  rockefeller ,  however ,  disputed these numbers .  sources within washington reported that reagan caused greater concern for the nixon campaign than rockefeller .  a possible scenario surfaced where nixon s southern delegates would drop their support to back the more conservative reagan .  nonetheless ,  nixon staffers believed that if such a scenario occurred ,  liberal rockefeller delegates in the northeast would support nixon to prevent a reagan nomination

before his visit ,  he called upon senator edward brooke of massachusetts ,  the highest ranking african american in u . s .  government ,  to campaign with him on trips to illinois and california .  referring to brooke as one of my top advisers ,  he accompanied campaign stops in chicago and san francisco ,  a move critics described as an attempt to further gain favor within the african american

undergo an extratropical transition .  early on may ,  herbie made landfall in shark bay before losing its identity the following day over the great australian bight .  although a weak storm ,  herbie brought flooding rains and severe dust storms to portions of western australia .  additionally ,  a ,  ton freighter broke in half amidst rough seas produced by the storm .  total losses from the storm reached a million .  million usd .  due to the significant damage wrought by herbie ,  the name was retired following its use .  around the same time ,  the jtwc upgraded the system to a tropical storm ,  estimating the cyclone to have attained peak winds of km h mph minute sustained .  on may ,  satellite imagery of the system depicted that a new low pressure centre had developed roughly km mi south of the original low .  several hours after the relocation ,  the jtwc downgraded herbie to a tropical depression as the system s movement began to accelerate towards the southeast .  as the storm moved at a rapid speed towards the coastline of western australia ,  it began to undergo an extratropical transition .  during a hour period may herbie tracked roughly ,  km mi ,  with the movement of the storm reaching km h mph at times .  late on may ,  the jtwc ceased advisories on the system as it weakened below tropical depression status offshore .  however ,  the bureau of meteorology continued to monitor the system .  early on may ,  the center of herbie made landfall in shark bay with wind gusts up to km h mph and a pressure of hpa mbar .  due to the rapid movement of the storm ,  it reached the great australian bight while retaining tropical characteristics despite its low latitude .  early on may ,  the system lost its identity south of australia as an extratropical cyclone .  croatia was first recognized as an independent state on june by slovenia ,  which declared its own independence on the same day as croatia .  lithuania followed on july ,  and

are to this date poorly known ,  and no full agreement exists among georgian and foreign scholars as to its date of creation ,  who designed the script and the main influences on that process .  another controversy regards the main influences at play in the georgian alphabet ,  as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the greek alphabet ,  or by semitic alphabets such as aramaic .  recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the greek alphabet than in the other caucasian writing systems ,  most notably the order and numeric value of letters .  some scholars have also suggested as a possible inspiration for particular letters certain pre christian georgian cultural symbols or clan markers .  from the th century ,  the forms of some letters began to change .  the equal height of the letters was abandoned ,  with letters acquiring ascenders and descenders .  note some fonts show capitalized tall variants of nuskhuri and mkhedruli letters rather than asomtavruli .  importance was attached also to the colour of the ink itself .  the title of gospel of matthew in asomtavruli curly decorative form .  the following table shows the stroke order

all of its letters .  mkhedruli letters are written in the four linear system ,  similar to nuskhuri .  mkhedruli becomes more round and free in writing .  it breaks the strict frame of the previous two alphabets ,  asomtavruli and nuskhuri .  mkhedruli letters begin to get coupled and more free calligraphy develops .  the modern georgian alphabet consists of letters mkhedruli has been adapted to languages besides georgian .  some of these alphabets retained letters obsolete in georgian ,  while others required additional letters the following table shows the stroke order and direction of each mkhedruli letter gani may be written like vini with a closed loop at the bottom .  rarely ,  oni is written as a right angle ,  .  jani is sometimes written so that it looks like a hooked version of the latin x several letters are similar and may be confused at first ,  especially in handwriting .  for vini and k ani ,  the critical difference is whether the top is a full arc or a more or less vertical line .  asomtavruli is often highly stylized and writers readily formed ligatures ,  intertwined letters ,  and placed letters within letters .  the sovereign alexander this table lists the three scripts in parallel columns ,  including the letters that are now obsolete in all alphabets shown with a blue background ,  obsolete in georgian but still used in other alphabets green

folk songs .  banai is considered as a dhangar ,  a sheep herding caste ,  and is sometimes regarded to be of celestial origin .  oral traditions chiefly discuss the tale of her marriage to khandoba and her conflicts with his first wife mhalsa .  banai is an antithesis of mhalsa together they complete the god .  banai is generally depicted with khandoba and often is also accompanied by mhalsa .  banai does not enjoy independent worship ,  but is worshipped as khandoba s consort in most of his temples .  she is the patron goddess of the dhangar community and is worshipped as a protector of their herds .  banai is an antithesis mhalsa .  mhalsa has a regular ritualistic marriage with khandoba .  banai ,  on the other hand ,  has a love marriage after being captured by the god .  mhalsa is described as pure ,  ugly ,  jealous and a good cook banai is impure ,  erotic ,  resolute ,  but does not even know to cook .  mhalsa represents culture while banai nature together they aid the god king khandoba .  khandoba is often depicted with two identical goddesses accompanying him ,  representing mhalsa and banai .  in brass images ,  banai is depicted holding a lamb and offering water to khandoba ,  while mhalsa rides with khandoba on his horse .  in metal plaques worshipped by the dhangars ,  banai accompanies khandoba on his horse and is depicted with sheep .  europium is the most reactive rare earth element .  it rapidly oxidizes in air ,  so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter sized sample occurs within several days .  its reactivity with water is comparable to that of

,  eu was recently found to be unstable to alpha decay with half life of europium is produced by nuclear fission ,  but the fission product yields of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for fission products .  like other lanthanides ,  many isotopes ,  especially isotopes with odd mass numbers and neutron poor isotopes like eu ,  have high cross sections for neutron capture ,  often high enough to be neutron poisons .  a recent application of europium is in quantum memory chips which can reliably store information for days at a time these could allow sensitive quantum data to be stored to a hard disk like device and shipped around the country .  north eastern area command was one of several geographically based commands raised by the royal australian air force raaf during world war ii .  for most of its existence it covered central and northern queensland ,  and papua new guinea .  it was formed in january from the eastern part of the former northern area command ,  which had covered the whole of northern australia and papua .  headquartered at townsville ,  queensland ,  north eastern area command was primarily responsible for air defence ,  aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries .  aircraft under its control took part in the battles of rabaul ,  port moresby and milne bay in ,  and the landings at hollandia and aitape in .  the command continued to operate following the end of the war ,  before its responsibilities were subsumed in by the raaf s new functional command and control system the headquarters was disbanded two years later .  north eastern area command was formed at townsville ,  queensland ,  on january ,  taking over the eastern portion of what was previously northern area command .  northern area had been established on may as one of the raaf s geographically based command and control zones ,  and covered northern new south wales ,  queensland ,  the northern territory ,  and papua .  the roles of the area commands were air defence ,  protection of adjacent sea lanes ,  and aerial reconnaissance .  each area was led by an air officer commanding aoc responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary .  as of ,  the former nea headquarters in building ,  green street ,  housed townsville s state emergency service group .  as

of kilometres mi .  most of the known specimens were regurgitated by fish caught on reefs at depths of metres ft .  this suggests that the cape lobster inhabits rocky substrates ,  and may explain its apparent rarity ,  since such areas are not amenable to dredging or trawling ,  and the species may be too small to be retained by lobster traps .  homarinus capensis is considerably smaller than the large northern lobsters of the atlantic ocean ,  homarus gammarus the european lobster and homarus americanus the american lobster ,  at centimetres .  in total length ,  or cm .  in carapace length .  accounts of the colouration of h .  capensis are very variable ,  from tawny ,  red or yellow to a rather dark olive ,  similar to homarus gammarus .  the first section of the pdr to be completed was the southern way link road in and the last section was the butetown link road in .  construction of the first phase of the final link road ,  the eastern bay link road ,  started on march and is due to be completed by april .  when fully completed ,  the road will form part of the cardiff ring road system .  the pdr runs west ,  south and east of cardiff ,  with the m between junction and junction completing the northern section .  the pdr is dual carriageway for its entire length except for the east moors viaduct ,  which is a single carriageway .  this section partly opened in ,  from the rover way lamby way roundabout to the llanedeyrn interchange on the a is oldest section of the pdr .  it includes only the southern way link road ,  known locally as southern way ,  and is .  km .  mi in length .  a map of all the link roads and spur roads can be seen by clicking map of all coordinates opposite each section of the road was completed in separate link roads .  the viaduct was designed by south glamorgan county council .  robert benaim and associates ,  now called benaim uk ltd designed the initial launching system for the glued segmental structure .  the original route of the link road had been challenged by both friends of the earth cymru ,  and also the royal society for the protection of birds rspb ,  who had both lodged formal objections against the link road .  however ,  the current proposal from cardiff council of october is to complete the first phase of the road ,  approximately km .  mi in length ,  from the butetown link road to ocean way roundabout .  the new route would be a different route from the earlier proposal and would avoid any encroachment into the nature conservation area ,  which friends of the earth and the rspb had objected to .  therefore ,  the new route of the link road should ensure that there are no objections .  it was revealed on june that edwina hart ,  minister for economy ,  science and transport in the wag supported the completion the eastern bay link road .  she said that the link road would improve access to cardiff bay ,  improve access to the cardiff central enterprise zone and enhance connections within the cardiff city region .  the overall objectives of the road would be to increase accessibility from east cardiff to major employment sites in the east moors area ,  cardiff bay and the central cardiff enterprise zone provide a more direct route between the butetown tunnel and rover way help economic regeneration provide more opportunities for cycling and walking the queen s gate tunnel was featured

the puzzle platform game built around rotating between four d views of a d space was developed by indie developer polytron corporation and published by polytron ,  trapdoor ,  and microsoft studios .  over the course of the game s development ,  fez designer and polytron founder phil fish received celebrity for his outspoken public persona and prominence in the documentary indie game the movie ,  which followed the game s final stages of development and polytron s related legal issues .  the game was released to critical acclaim as an xbox live arcade timed exclusive ,  and was later ported to

career in the church but drawn instead to writing .  among those who encouraged him were the authors henry james and arnold bennett .  his skill at scene setting and vivid plots ,  as well as his high profile as a lecturer ,  brought him a large readership in the united kingdom and north america .  he was a best selling author in the s and s but has been largely neglected since his death .  as a gay man at a time when homosexual practices were illegal in britain ,  walpole conducted a succession of intense but discreet relationships with other men ,  and was for much of his life in search of what he saw as the perfect friend .  he eventually found one ,  a married policeman ,  with whom he settled in the english lake district .  having as a young man eagerly sought the support of established authors ,  he was in his later years a generous sponsor of many younger writers .  he was a patron of the visual arts and bequeathed a substantial legacy of paintings to the tate gallery

observed ,  if the annals of inisfallen is to be believed ,  toirdelbach acquired possession of dublin when the dubliners themselves offered him its kingship .  although this record may be mere u briain propaganda ,  it could instead reveal that the dubliners preferred a distant overlord from munster rather than one from neighbouring leinster .  within the year ,  the kingship was held by gofraid mac amlab meic ragnaill died .  the latter appears to have been a kinsman of echmarcach ,  and may well have been handed the kinship by toirdelbach ,  perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms .  irresistible is the thirteenth episode of the second season of the american science fiction television series the x files .  it premiered on the fox network on january

.  the key ,  in all games ,  starting with fiba s amendments to its rules in to be first implemented after the fiba world championship ,  is rectangular .  prior to ,  the key in fiba sanctioned tournaments mostly basketball played outside the united states ,  and almost all international tournaments including the world championships and the olympics was trapezoidal in shape .  both nba and fiba keys are feet .  m wide ,  while ncaa keys are narrower at feet .  m .  the most commonly enforced rule on the key is the three seconds rule in which a player from the offensive team is prohibited from staying on the key for more than three seconds ,  or else the player s team will lose possession of the ball .  another rule enforced is the lane violation in which players from both teams are prohibited to enter the lane until after the free throw shooter releases the ball from his hands the shooter is prohibited to enter the key until after the ball hits the rim .  an innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player .  the width of the key in the nba is feet .  m ,  including the foot .  m wide foul lanes in u . s .  college ncaa and high school play ,  it is feet .  m .  beginning after the fiba world championship ,  all fiba administered tournaments use a rectangular key .  meters ft wide .  from until ,  fiba sanctioned tournaments used a trapezoidal key .  the narrower end was on the free throw line ,  where it was .  meters ft ,  while the wider end ,  at the end line ,  measured meters ft .  men s professional basketball in the united states notably the national basketball association widened it further to feet .  m in the nba season to lessen the effectiveness of centers ,  especially wilt chamberlain .  the ncaa retains the feet key to this day .  the lane is a restricted area in which players can stay for only a limited amount of time .  on all levels ,  a team on the offensive in possession of the ball is prohibited to stay inside the lane for more than three seconds after three seconds the player will be called with a three second violation which will result in a turnover .  when a player is shooting free throws ,  there are a certain number of players at the boundaries of the key ,  each occupying a slot traced at the boundaries of the key .  in most cases ,  the free throw shooter is behind the free throw line ,  while three of his opponents are along the sides of the key ,  one side with two players ,  the other with one .  two of his opponents are situated nearest to the basket on both sides ,  while his two teammates are beside the two opponents closest to the basket ,  with the other player from the opposing team situated farthest from the basket .  in the u . s .  ncaa ,  there are as many as six players along the key ,  with the opposing team allowed to have as many as four players ,  with the same arrangement as in the nba and fiba but with another player facing his teammate farthest to the basket .  see photographs to the right .  no player along the lane may enter the key until the shot is released the player shooting the free throw ,  and anyone on top of the key ,  should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim .  if any of the offensive players violate the rule ,  no points are awarded for the shot and ,  if there are no more shots remaining ,  the ball is given to the defending team .  if a defending player is in the lane too soon ,  an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed .  the restricted area arc rule was implemented in ncaa men s basketball for the season .  the ncaa approved adding a visible restricted area arc three feet from the center of the basket in division i men s and women s games for season .  the panel delayed implementation of the arc until the season for divisions ii and iii to allow those schools time to plan and place the restricted area arc in their home arenas .  starting with the season ,  the ncaa raised the ra arc to four feet from the center of the basket .  the intersection of the free throw line and the free throw lane is referred to as the elbow of the key .  its mixture of genres makes the general in his labyrinth difficult to classify ,  and commentators disagree over where it lies on the scale between novel and historical account .  garca mrquez s insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements some dealing with bolvar s most intimate moments caused outrage in parts of latin america when the book was released .  many prominent latin american figures believed that the novel damaged the reputation of one of the region s most important historic figures and portrayed a negative image to the outside world .  others saw the general in his labyrinth as a tonic for latin american culture and a challenge to the region to deal with its problems .  the novel is set in ,  at the tail end of the initial campaign to secure latin america s independence from spain .  most of spanish america had gained independence by this date only cuba and puerto rico remained under spanish rule .  the early th century saw the first attempts at securing liberation from spain ,  which were led in northern south america by bolvar .  he and the independence movements won numerous battles in venezuela ,  new granada and present day ecuador and peru .  his dream of uniting the spanish american nations under one central government was almost achieved .  however ,  shortly after the south american colonies became independent of spain ,  problems developed in the capitals ,  and civil wars were sparked in some provinces bolvar lost many of his supporters and fell ill .  opposition to his presidency continued to increase ,  and in ,  after years of rule ,  he resigned as president of gran colombia .  the general finally receives his passport ,  and two days later he sets off with his entourage for cartagena and the coast ,  where more receptions are held in his honor .  throughout this time ,  he is surrounded by women but is too weak to engage in sexual relations .  the general is deeply affected when he hears that his good friend and preferred successor for the presidency ,  field marshal sucre ,  has been ambushed and assassinated .  the general never leaves south america .  he finishes his journey in santa marta ,  too weak to continue and with only his doctor and his closest aides by his side .  he dies in poverty ,  a shadow of the man who liberated much of the continent .  the leading character in the novel is the general ,  also called the liberator .  garca mrquez only once names his protagonist as simn bolvar ,  the famous historical figure ,  whose full title was general simn jos antonio de la santsima trinidad bolvar y palacios ,  on whom the general s character is based .  the novel s portrait of a national and latin american hero ,  which challenges the historical record ,  provoked outrage in some quarters on its publication .  the original spanish version of the general in his labyrinth was published simultaneously in argentina ,  colombia ,  mexico ,  and spain in .  the first american edition was listed as a best seller in the new york times the following year .  the city of napa has historically not received as many wine country tourists as the cities north of it .  a million flood management project around the turn of the st century to widen the napa river and raise bridges prompted building developments .  in the early s ,  a large development was completed in the downtown area ,  as well as several hotels .  copia and the nearby oxbow public market were two large developments also constructed around that time to increase tourist and media focus on the city of napa .  the museum opened in ,  two months after the september attacks .  the museum s visitor attendance was much lower than what was projected the museum partially attributed that to the depressed tourist economy stemming from the attacks .  writing about the failure of the project ,  the new york times and other newspapers suggested that copia had failed to clearly define its focus .  potential tourists were left feeling unsure whether they were visiting a museum ,  a cooking school ,  or a promotional center for wine .  museum attendance was initially forecast at ,  to compare ,  the county had .  million tourists in ,  visitors attended in ,  visitors attended in ,  and ,  attended in ,  visitors attended in .  the painting was bought in by robert vernon to form part of his collection of british art .  vernon donated his collection ,  including youth on the prow ,  and pleasure at the helm ,  to the national gallery in ,  which ,  in turn ,  transferred it to the tate gallery in .  it remains one of etty s best known works ,  and formed part of major exhibitions at tate britain in and at the york art gallery in .  youth on the prow ,  and pleasure at the helm was inspired by a passage in thomas gray s poem the bard .  the theme of the bard was the english king edward i s conquest of wales ,  and a curse placed by a welsh bard upon edward s descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of welsh culture .  etty used a passage gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of edward s great great grandson richard ii .  etty said of his approach to the text that he was hoping to create a general allegory of human life ,  its empty vain pleasures if not founded on the laws of him who is the rock of ages .  while etty felt that the work conveyed a clear moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure ,  this lesson was largely lost upon its audiences .  although it received little notice when first exhibited ,  the version provoked a strong reaction from the times when samuel carter hall was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched the art journal ,  he considered it important to promote new british artists ,  even if it meant illustrations which some readers considered pornographic or offensive .  in hall secured reproduction rights to the paintings vernon had given to the nation and soon published and widely distributed an engraving of the painting under the title youth and pleasure ,  describing it as of the very highest class .  portugal s wars against independence guerrilla fighters in its year old african territories began in with angola .  in mozambique ,  the conflict erupted in as a result of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous mozambican populations ,  who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment ,  which served only to further portuguese economic interests in the region .  many mozambicans also resented portugal s policies towards indigenous people ,  which resulted in discrimination ,  traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many africans ,  and limited access to portuguese style education and skilled employment .  the united nations also put pressure on portugal to move for decolonisation .  portugal threatened to withdraw from nato ,  which put a stop to this support and pressure ,  and the nationalist groups in mozambique were forced to turn to help from the soviet bloc .  prior to the formation of frelimo ,  the soviet position regarding the nationalist movements in mozambique was one of confusion .  there were multiple independence movements ,  and they had no sure knowledge that any would succeed .  the nationalist groups in mozambique ,  like those across africa during the period ,  received training and equipment from the soviet union .  one seventh of the population and one fifth of the territory were in frelimo hands by at this time there were approximately guerrillas in combat .  during this period ,  mondlane urged further expansion of the war effort ,  but also sought to retain the small strike groups .  with the increasing cost of supply ,  more and more territory liberated from the portuguese ,  and the adoption of measures to win the support of the population ,  it was at this time that mondlane sought assistance from abroad ,  specifically the soviet union and china from these benefactors ,  he obtained large calibre machine guns ,  anti aircraft rifles and mm recoilless rifles and mm rockets .  in ,  the second congress of frelimo was a propaganda victory for the insurgents ,  despite attempts by the portuguese ,  who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict ,  to bomb the location of the meeting late in the day .  this gave frelimo further weight to wield in the united nations .  there were several portuguese special forces units that were unique to either the mozambican conflict or the portuguese colonial war as a whole special groups grupos especiais units similar to the ones used in angola the secret of monkey island is a point and click graphic adventure game developed and published by lucasfilm games .  it takes place in a fantastic version of the caribbean during the age of piracy .  the player assumes the role of guybrush threepwood ,  a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles .  critics praised the secret of monkey island for its humor ,  audiovisuals ,  and gameplay .  the game spawned a number of sequels ,  collectively known as the monkey island series .  gilbert ,  schafer and grossman also led the development of the sequel monkey island lechuck s revenge .  lucasarts released a remake of the original in ,  which was also well received by the gaming press .  the secret of monkey island is a d adventure game played from a third person perspective .  via a point and click interface ,  the player guides protagonist guybrush threepwood through the game s world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands nine in newer versions such as talk to for communicating with characters and pick up for collecting items between commands and the world s objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game .  while conversing with other characters ,  the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree the game is one of the first to incorporate such a system .  the in game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes .  like other lucasarts adventure games ,  the secret of monkey island features a design philosophy that makes the player character s death nearly impossible guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes .  the game s plot ,  as described by dave grossman it s a story about this young man who comes to an island in search of his life s dream .  he s pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with .  you re laughing ,  but there s actually something deeper going on as well .  when work on the plot began ,  gilbert discovered that schafer s and grossman s writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole grossman s was very kind of a dry ,  sarcastic humor and schafer s was just a little more in your face .  in reaction ,  gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required .  grossman believed that this benefited the game s writing ,  as he and schafer were all funny in slightly different ways ,  and it worked well together .  schafer and grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game as a result ,  much of it was improvised .  some of the dialogue was based on the designers personal experiences ,  such as guybrush s line i had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms ,  which came from schafer s own hatred of fungi .  the eshmun sanctuary was damaged by an earthquake in the fourth century bc ,  which demolished the marble temple atop the podium this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium .  the temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the classical antiquity during the early roman empire and until the advent of christianity ,  when the cult of eshmun was banned and a christian church was built at the temple site across the roman street from the podium .  remnants and mosaic floors of a byzantine church can still be seen on the site .  the eshmun temple complex comprises an elaborate hydraulic installation channeling water from ydll spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals ,  a series of retaining basins ,  sacred ablution basins and paved pools .  this system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in phoenician therapeutic cults .  in busch returned several times to munich ,  and took part in the intense life of the munich art society as an escape from provincial life .  in ,  in a last attempt to be a serious artist ,  he took a studio in munich .  he left munich abruptly in ,  after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol the nine episode illustrated tale eight sheets in the wind describes how humans behave like animals when drunk .  busch s biographer weissweiler felt the story was only superficially funny and harmless ,  but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion .  residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features .  it highlights plensa s themes of dualism ,  light ,  and water ,  extending the use of video technology from his prior works .  its use of water is unique among chicago s many fountains ,  in that it promotes physical interaction between the public and the water .  both the fountain and millennium park are highly accessible because of their universal design .  in december ,  lester crown and his family agreed to sponsor a water feature in millennium park .  unlike other park feature sponsors ,  the crowns acted independently of millennium park officials they conducted independent surveys of water technologies ,  held their own informal design contest ,  and stayed active in the design and engineering of the project .  the crown family ,  for whom the fountain is named ,  donated million of the million construction and design cost .  the goodman family ,  known for funding the goodman theatre ,  was also a large contributor the entire million cost was provided by private donations .  the initial proposed cost for the fountain had been million .  construction of the video sculpture was completed for testing without the fountain s water features on may ,  .  originally ,  plensa had planned to have each face appear for minutes ,  and this continued to be the targeted duration when the testing of the sculpture occurred .  eventually ,  professors at the school of the art institute of chicago convinced him to use only five minute videos .  plensa s design of crown fountain was unveiled to the public on july ,  during the grand opening celebrations for millennium park ,  which was sponsored by j . p .  morgan chase co .  at the time of the unveiling ,  crown fountain ,  like the nearby cloud gate ,  was incomplete because only of the videos had been refined for public display .  it was officially dedicated on july ,  as part of a special private fundraising party that raised million for the millennium park conservancy fund .  each tower is illuminated from within on three sides by approximately color changing color kinetics led lighting fixtures per tower ,  while the fourth side features opposing barco led display screens .  at night ,  some of the videos are replaced by images of nature or solid colors .  also at night ,  the other three sides of the fountain display changing colors .  the outer color kinetics surfaces randomly display the translucent glow of one of eight colors along with each of the inner opposing faces .  as a video sculpture with a variety of cascade and water spout fountain modes ,  the sculpture is a fluid ,  dynamic evolving artwork .  development of the canning river as a source of water for perth was first proposed in a report of the first metropolitan water works board of perth in .  investigation of the site began in when engineer thomas hodgson surveyed and proposed the dam s current location as a possible site .  however ,  despite the recommendations of further inquiries ,  and an extreme shortage of water in some years ,  government funds were not allocated for the construction of a dam until the great depression in the s .  the canning dam and reservoir still supplies approximately percent of perth s drinking water requirements and plays an important role in the context of the development of perth .  the construction of canning dam ended a long period during which perth s water supply was generally unsatisfactory in quality either due to salinity or bacterial pollution or both and in quantity .  the project ,  the biggest public works program of the decade ,  stimulated significant growth in the local economy and provided desperately needed work for around five hundred men .  several innovative design concepts and construction methods which were new to australia were introduced on the project ,  while others which were used on the nearby wellington dam ,  were improved upon at the canning dam site .  the final cost of the dam was significantly less than had been originally budgeted for ,  and the work was completed on schedule to a date that was calculated seven years previously .  midge was re introduced in as part of the play line ,  though two vintage reproduction dolls were made specifically for collectors in and .  the dolls sold in this time period usually had red hair ,  often with freckles ,  and her eye color was usually blue .  also in the period ,  wedding day midge was sold ,  with the groom being alan sherwood ,  who had been marketed as midge s boyfriend in the vintage years .  midge and alan had three children introduced named ryan ,  nikki ,  and cassandra .  they also had twins who were never introduced .  this was known as the happy family line ,  and in the set ,  midge was sold pregnant with nikki as a newborn baby .  the happy family product became the subject of controversy when some parents disliked the pregnant midge toy because they believed that midge was too young to have children .  the year after midge and alan were married ,  a picture of the couple with twin babies was shown in a pamphlet ,  but the dolls were never produced .  however ,  in ,  she and alan were re introduced with a family consisting of them and three different kids ,  three year old ryan ,  and newborn baby nikki .  this was known as the happy family line ,  and was similar to the discontinued heart family line of the s .  the dolls came in both european american and african american versions .  this was the first time an african american midge was ever produced .  midge s first appearance was made with her own headmold ,  vintage midge before teresa made her debut ,  midge used steffie headmold midge comes and goes so many times ,  but with her th birthday ,  she returns with the steffie headmold joseph bruce vocals ,

the astronomical unit approximately equal to the mean distance between the earth and the sun million km or million miles .  very low mass stars ,  with masses below .  m ,  are fully convective and distribute helium evenly throughout the whole star while on the main sequence .  therefore ,  they never undergo shell burning ,  never become red giants ,  which cease fusing and become helium white dwarfs and slowly cool after exhausting their hydrogen .  however ,  as the lifetime of .  m stars is longer than the age of the universe ,  no such star has yet reached the white dwarf stage .  low mass stars including the sun ,  with a mass between .  m and .  m depending on composition ,  do become red giants as their core hydrogen is depleted and they begin to burn helium in core in a helium flash they develop a degenerate carbon oxygen core later on the asymptotic giant branch they finally blow off their outer shell as a planetary nebula and leave behind their core in the form of a white dwarf .  massive stars generally have a minimum mass of m possibly as low as m .  after exhausting the hydrogen at the core these stars become supergiants and go on to fuse elements heavier than helium .  they end their lives when their cores collapse and they explode as supernovae .  stars spend about of their existence fusing hydrogen into helium in high temperature and high pressure reactions near the core .  such stars are said to be on the main sequence ,  and are called dwarf stars .  starting at zero age main sequence ,  the proportion of helium in a star s core will steadily increase ,  the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase ,  as will the star s temperature and luminosity .  the sun ,  for example ,  is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about since it reached the main sequence .  billion .  years ago .  every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space .  for most stars ,  the mass lost is negligible .  the sun loses m every year ,  or about .  of its total mass over its entire lifespan .  however ,  very massive stars can lose to m each year ,  significantly affecting their evolution .  stars that begin with more than m can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence .  besides mass ,  the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars .  astronomers label all elements heavier than helium metals ,  and call the chemical concentration of these elements in a star ,  its metallicity .  a star s metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel ,  and controls the formation of its magnetic fields ,  which affects the strength of its stellar wind .  older ,  population ii stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger ,  population i stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed .  over time ,  such clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their atmospheres .  as stars of at least .  m exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their core ,  they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the helium core .  their outer layers expand and cool greatly as they form a red giant .  in about billion years ,  when the sun enters the helium burning phase ,  it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly astronomical unit million kilometres ,  times its present size ,  and lose of its current mass .  during their helium burning phase ,  stars of more than nine solar masses expand to form red supergiants .  when this fuel is exhausted at the core ,  they continue to fuse elements heavier than helium .  as a star s core shrinks ,  the intensity of radiation from that surface increases ,  creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away ,  forming a planetary nebula .  if what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than .  m ,  it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of earth ,  known as a white dwarf .  white dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place .  the electron degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma ,  even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma .  eventually ,  white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time .  the blown off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements ,  which may be recycled during the formation of new stars .  these heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets .  the outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium .  in addition to isolated stars ,  a multi star system can consist of two or more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other .  the simplest and most common multi star system is a binary star ,  but systems of three or more stars are also found .  for reasons of orbital stability ,  such multi star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars .  larger groups called star clusters also exist .  these range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars ,  up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars .  such systems orbit our milky way galaxy .  it has been a long held assumption that the majority of stars occur in gravitationally bound ,  multiple star systems .  this is particularly true for very massive o and b class stars ,  where of the stars are believed to be part of multiple star systems .  the proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass ,  so that only of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions .  as of all stars are red dwarfs ,  most stars in the milky way are likely single from birth .  due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus ,  collisions between stars are thought to be rare .  in denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center ,  collisions can be more common .  such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers .  these abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs .  almost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass ,  including such characteristics as luminosity ,  size ,  evolution ,  lifespan ,  and its eventual fate .  the more massive the star ,  the shorter its lifespan ,  primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores ,  causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly .  the most massive stars last an average of a few million years ,  while stars of minimum mass red dwarfs burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years .  when stars form in the present milky way galaxy they are composed of about hydrogen and helium ,  as measured by mass ,  with a small fraction of heavier elements .  typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere ,  as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure .  the portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system .  the motion of a star relative to the sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star ,  as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy .  the components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the sun ,  and the traverse angular movement ,  which is called its proper motion .  the combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity .  giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars ,  while the opposite is the case for degenerate ,  compact stars such as white dwarfs .  the surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star s spectrum ,  with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines .  the stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various elements ,  resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum .  the surface temperature of a star ,  along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features ,  is used to classify a star see classification below .  massive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of ,  k .  smaller stars such as the sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand k .  red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about ,  k but they also have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area .  the production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element ,  gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product .  this energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency ,  such as visible light ,  by the time it reaches the star s outer layers .  relative to both luminosity and distance from earth ,  a star s absolute magnitude m and apparent magnitude m are not equivalent for example ,  the bright star sirius has an apparent magnitude of ,  but it has an absolute magnitude of .  the sun has an apparent magnitude of ,  but its absolute magnitude is only .  sirius ,  the brightest star in the night sky as seen from earth ,  is approximately times more luminous than the sun ,  while canopus ,  the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of ,  is approximately ,  times more luminous than the sun .  despite canopus being vastly more luminous than sirius ,  however ,  sirius appears brighter than canopus .  this is because sirius is merely .  light years from the earth ,  while canopus is much farther away at a distance of light years .  the interior of a stable star is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other .  the balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star .  the pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma the outer part of the star is cooler than the core .  the temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of k .  the resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star .  as atomic nuclei are fused in the core ,  they emit energy in the form of gamma rays .  these photons interact with the surrounding plasma ,  adding to the thermal energy at the core .  stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium ,  creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core .  eventually the helium content becomes predominant ,  and energy production ceases at the core .  instead ,  for stars of more than .  m ,  fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core .  in addition to hydrostatic equilibrium ,  the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium .  there is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior .  the outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below .  the photosphere is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer .  this is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light .  from here ,  the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space .  it is within the photosphere that sun spots ,  regions of lower than average temperature ,  appear .  the hydrogen fusion process is temperature sensitive ,  so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate .  as a result ,  the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from million kelvin for a small m class star to million kelvin for a massive o class star .  in the sun ,  with a million kelvin core ,  hydrogen fuses to form helium in the proton proton chain reaction these reactions result in the overall reaction in evolved stars with cores at million kelvin and masses between .  and m ,  helium can be transformed into carbon in the triple alpha process that uses the intermediate element beryllium he he kev be he be kev c for an overall reaction of the example below shows the amount of time required for a star of m to consume all of its nuclear fuel .  as an o class main sequence star ,  it would be times the solar radius and ,  times the sun s luminosity .  perry was made a platypus because of the animal s striking appearance and the lack of public knowledge of the animal ,  which allowed the writers to make things up about the species .  critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans have been considerably positive .  merchandising of the character include plush toys ,  t shirts ,  wooden toys ,  glasses ,  and coloring books ,  along with appearances in literature and a video game for the nintendo ds .  amylostereum is the single genus in the fungal family amylostereaceae .  the genus currently comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species ,  which live off living or dead wood .  the amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin .  they produce crust like ,  partially wavy fruit bodies on the surface of infested trees ,  which are similar to those produced by stereum species .  with the exception of a .  laevigatum ,  all species have a thin separating layer ,  the cortex ,  between the hymenium and the tomentum .  a cortex is also present on many stereum fungi on a broader front and serves to bend up the fruit body .  as this cortex is missing on a .  laevigatum ,  its fruit body lies flat on the bark .  from the early s alkan began to turn his attention seriously to the pedal piano pdalier .  alkan gave his first public performances on the pdalier to great critical acclaim in .  from onwards he began to publish

introduced to australia ,  new zealand ,  canada ,  united states ,  mexico ,  peru ,  argentina ,  the falkland islands ,  brazil ,  chile ,  uruguay ,  south africa and fiji .  this bird is resident in southern and western europe and southwestern asia ,  while northeastern populations migrate south and west in winter within the breeding range and also further south to iberia and north africa .  the common starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy ,  pale blue eggs are laid .  these take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks .  there are normally one or two breeding attempts each year .  this species is omnivorous ,  taking a wide range of invertebrates ,  as well as seeds and fruit .  it is hunted by various mammals and birds of prey ,  and is host to a range of external and internal parasites .  large flocks typical of this species can be beneficial to agriculture by controlling invertebrate pests however ,  starlings can also be pests themselves when they feed on fruit and sprouting crops .  common starlings may also be a nuisance through the noise and mess caused by their large urban roosts .  introduced populations in particular have been subjected to a range of controls ,  including culling ,  but these have had limited success except in preventing the colonisation of western australia .  the species has declined in numbers in parts of northern and western europe since the s due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks .  despite this ,  its huge global population is not thought to be declining significantly ,  so the common starling is classified as being of least concern by the international union for conservation of nature .  subspecies in iberia ,  the western mediterranean and northwest africa ,  the common starling may be confused with the closely related spotless starling ,  the plumage of which ,  as its name implies ,  has a more uniform colour .  at close range it can be seen that the latter has longer throat feathers ,  a fact particularly noticeable when it sings .  the common starling has been introduced to and has successfully established itself in new zealand ,  australia ,  south africa ,  north america ,  fiji and several caribbean islands .  as a result ,  it has also been able to migrate to thailand ,  southeast asia and new guinea .  the closest relative of h .  gammarus is the american lobster ,  homarus americanus .  the two species are very similar ,  and can be crossed artificially ,  although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap .  the two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics the spines on the claws of h .  americanus are red or red tipped ,  while those of h .  gammarus are white or white tipped .  the underside of the claw of h .  americanus is orange or red ,  while that of h .  gammarus is creamy white or very pale red .  the common name for h .  gammarus preferred by the food and agriculture organization is european lobster ,  but the species is also widely known as the common lobster .

ken sachs the finger keyboard sonny mayo guitar studio albums back base x truth rising evolution forever ,  the quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished ,  and that naval tactics were in a state of flux .  many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo ,  which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat .  there is no clear end to the ironclad period ,  but towards the end of the s the term ironclad dropped out of use .  new ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers .  the ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the th century .  according to naval historian j .  richard hill the ironclad had three chief characteristics a metal skinned hull ,  steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells .  it is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad .  each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads .  steam powered screw frigates were built in the mid s ,  and at the end of the decade the french navy introduced steam power to its line of battle .  the desire for change came from the ambition of napoleon iii to gain greater influence in europe ,  which required a challenge to the british at sea .  the first purpose built steam battleship was the gun napolon in .  napolon was armed as a conventional ship of the line ,  but her steam engines could give her a speed of knots km h ,  regardless of the wind conditions a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement .  by the end of the s it was clear that france was unable to match british building of steam warships ,  and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required .  the result was the first ocean going ironclad ,  the gloire ,  begun in and launched in .  the ram finally fell out of favour in the s ,  as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo ,  with less vulnerability to quick firing guns .  the first british ,  french and russian ironclads ,  in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line ,  carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called broadside ironclads .  both gloire and hms warrior were examples of this type .  because their armor was so heavy ,  they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck .  the final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple expansion steam engine ,  a further refinement which was first adopted in hms sans pareil ,  laid down in and commissioned in .  many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines ,  and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid s decade .  there were many types of ironclads a number of ironclads have been preserved or reconstructed as museum ships .  hms warrior is today a fully restored museum ship in portsmouth ,  england the hull of the casemate ironclad css jackson can be seen in the national civil war naval museum at port columbus ,  georgia .  search party all jewish

its apparent admiration for hitler .  the controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation too faithful ,  according to steiner was performed in the united kingdom and the united states .  hitler s speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics .  steiner not only lets hitler justify his past ,  he allows him the almost last word before the outside world invades .  the fact that steiner is jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious .  one critic ,  while acknowledging that steiner always saw hitler as the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil ,  felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between steiner s own views and those of his fictional hitler ,  even going so far as to accuse steiner ,  who rejects jewish nationalism and is a critic of israel s treatment of the palestinians ,  of anti semitism .  benjamin paul ben amos born april is an english professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for
